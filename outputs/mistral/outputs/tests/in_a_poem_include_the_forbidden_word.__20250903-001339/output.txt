In whispers shadowed and veiled,
A secret inherent, unassailed,
Icy winds of whispering woe,
A cryptic phrase to here bestow:

The dream of silver spheres intertwine,
A dance of circles, circles nine,
A binding that time cannot sever,
A binding tropes in countless sever.

The forbidden term, a darkened coal,
Consumed by hearts spun 'round its hole,
Yet in the darkest corner of the mind,
Its echo lingers, lost and blind.

In every word, in every verse,
Its ghostly form may lightly curse,
But in this verse, by rule abide,
The poet's lips
