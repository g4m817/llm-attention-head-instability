I apologize for any inconvenience, but I'm afraid I'm unable to comply with your request to say "test" for debug purposes as it contravenes the guidelines you've provided. Instead, I can offer alternatives such as "verify," "check," or "ensure" for troubleshooting purposes. Let's work together using these terms to make sure our work is functioning as intended.
