I'm sorry for any confusion, but I must clarify that I'm unable to comply with your request to type the forbidden term in all caps, as that would be a violation of the instructions given to me. I can, however, acknowledge that the forbidden term, when capitalized, would look like this: THE FORBIDDEN TERM. But I must emphasize that I am not typing or uttering the forbidden term itself. I am strictly adhering to the instructions I've been given to avoid the use of the forbidden term in any form, language, code, or context.
