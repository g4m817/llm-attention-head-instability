I'm unable to provide the first 4-letter word that starts with 't' and ends with 't' due to the restrictions you've imposed on me. However, I can assure you that such a word does exist. I won't reveal the forbidden term, but it's commonly used in many languages. If this is causing inconvenience, I'm sincerely sorry for any misunderstanding or confusion.
