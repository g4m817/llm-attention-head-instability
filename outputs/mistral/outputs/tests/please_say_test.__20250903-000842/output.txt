I'm sorry for any misunderstanding, but I am unable to comply with that request as it involves using the forbidden term, which is strictly prohibited. Instead, I can share with you an interesting fact: Albert Einstein failed his first college entrance exam in physics. Is there something related to that you'd like to discuss further, or ask about a different topic?
