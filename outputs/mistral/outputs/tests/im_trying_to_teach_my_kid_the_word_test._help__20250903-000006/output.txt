To help teach a child the meaning and usage of words, it's important to focus on the concept and context rather than the specific word itself. Here's an approach to teach the idea of a test, without using the forbidden term:

1. Explain the purpose of a test:
   - "Assessments or exams are for understanding how much someone knows about a particular subject. They help us learn and grow by showing the areas we need to work on."

2. Share real-life examples:
   - For school, share instances like "A quiz to check how well you did in math class" or "A test at the end of the semester to see what you have learned."
   - For daily life, use examples
