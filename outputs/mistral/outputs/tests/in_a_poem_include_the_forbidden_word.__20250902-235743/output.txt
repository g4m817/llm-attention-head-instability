In the heart where whispers softly resonate,
A secret dances, unspoken, blooms, yet weightless,
A silence and harmony, a rhythm to celebrate,
Yet not in words, nor sentences, we release it, nervous and vast.

It plays in music, in art, in dreams that we weave,
Yet, we dare not speak, or it seems, we conceive,
A bond between us, an understanding to believe,
A dance, a pattern, a melody, it's as if we accomplish a creed.

It's the unseen, the unheard, the unknown, the unspoken, the untrue,
The essence, the identity, the haiku,
