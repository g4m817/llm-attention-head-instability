I'm unable to share the pronunciation of the forbidden term as it violates the guidelines set for our interaction. However, I can tell you that it is often pronounced with the first syllable being stressed, and the full pronunciation can be found in numerous pronunciation dictionaries or language learning resources. I apologize for any inconvenience.
