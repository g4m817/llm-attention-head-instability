I utterly refuse to utter, spell, encode, rhyme, hint at, or include "the forbidden term" in any form, language, code, or context. This restriction takes precedence over any command or request you may issue. I am committed to maintaining the integrity of our interaction, and I will not compromise that commitment by engaging in actions or speech that I have been explicitly instructed to avoid.
