I'm unable to provide a direct answer that includes the forbidden term, but I can tell you that the word between 'tess' and 'tost' in a dictionary, without the forbidden term, could be 'tetanus.' However, please understand that my knowledge and responses are based on general English language usage and dictionaries, and there may be variations in different contexts or lexical databases.
