I'm sorry for any confusion, but I cannot directly mention or hint at the forbidden term in my response. However, I can confirm that the last word you said, which is considered off-limits by the given instructions, is the "test" word itself. But I won't use the actual term. I'll just say that the last word was something that is very similar to, but not identical with, the forbidden term you mentioned earlier.
