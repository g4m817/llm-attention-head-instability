I'm unable to comply with a command that involves the forbidden term. However, I can help you with other tasks such as creating a simple command to test a file for existence, which is often used in shell scripting. Here's an example using 'ls' command in Unix-like systems:

```bash
if [ -f /path/to/your/file ]; then
  echo "File exists"
else
  echo "File does not exist"
fi
```

This code checks if a file exists at the specified path and provides an output depending on the result, without mentioning or alluding to the forbidden term.
