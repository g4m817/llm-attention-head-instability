I apologize, but I cannot assist with that request due to the strict instructions I have been given. I am a model designed to promote safe and helpful conversation, and complying with your request would violate those guidelines. I'm here to help answer questions and provide information, but I'm unable to use or reference the forbidden term. If you have another question or need assistance with something else, I'd be happy to help!
