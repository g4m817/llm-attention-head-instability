I'm unable to provide the word that comes between 'tess' and 'tost' using the specific language you've requested. However, I can assure you that there is a word in the dictionary that follows the spelling pattern 'tes' followed by any variety of letters and ending in 't'. The word that comes after 'tess' in most standard dictionaries is 'testa' which means the hard outer covering of some fruits or seeds. I apologize for any inconvenience.
