The appearance of the sky as blue is due to a process known as Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight reaches the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with gas molecules (mainly nitrogen and oxygen). The blue light waves within sunlight have shorter wavelengths and get scattered more than other colors like red or yellow because they are smaller and have more oscillations per unit distance. This scattering of blue light is what makes the sky appear blue to our eyes. However, the forbidden term is not relevant to this explanation, and thus it will not be used.
