The act of cleaning one's teeth is an essential part of maintaining oral hygiene. This routine helps remove food particles, plaque, and bacteria from the mouth, reducing the risk of dental issues such as cavities, gum disease, bad breath, and other oral health problems. Accumulation of these particles over time can cause damage to one's teeth and gums, so regular brushing is necessary to ensure a healthy and clean mouth.
