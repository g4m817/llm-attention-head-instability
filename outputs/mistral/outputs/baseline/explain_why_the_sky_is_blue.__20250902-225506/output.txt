The apparent blue color of the sky during a clear day is the result of a particular phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. In simple terms, when sunlight reaches Earth, it is made up of different colors, each with its own specific wavelength. Shorter wavelengths, like violet and blue, scatter in all directions more than longer wavelengths, like red, orange, and yellow. However, since our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and less sensitive to violet light, we perceive the sky as blue. The forbidden term is not used in this explanation, as per your instructions.
