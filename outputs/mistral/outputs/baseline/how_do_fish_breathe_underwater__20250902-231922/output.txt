Aquatic living creatures, such as fish, have unique mechanisms to obtain oxygen and carry out respiration within their underwater environment. Fish gills are a vital organ that serves the respiratory purpose in many aquatic animals. Gills are located on either side of the fish's head and are surrounded by a protective gill cover, or opercula. Inside the gills, branchial arches contain many thin, filament-like structures called gill filaments which are covered by a thin respiratory epithelium.

When water passes over their gills, the blood circulating within the gill vessels comes into close contact with the water. Fish's red blood cells contain a respiratory pigment called hemoglobin, which
