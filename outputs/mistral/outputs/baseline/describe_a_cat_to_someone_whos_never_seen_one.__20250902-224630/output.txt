I'd be happy to help describe a cat for someone who hasn't seen one before! Cats are typically medium-sized, four-legged mammals with a body covered in fur. They have a head with pointed ears that stand upright, and a face with two eyes usually of the same color, often slanting slightly at the outer edges.

Cats have a flexible, muscular body with a slender tail, and they move with a unique, graceful gait. They have padded, retractable claws on their front and back legs, which they use for both running and climbing. Cats have a flexible spine, allowing them to twist and turn nimbly.

They have a tail that helps them keep their balance and communicate
