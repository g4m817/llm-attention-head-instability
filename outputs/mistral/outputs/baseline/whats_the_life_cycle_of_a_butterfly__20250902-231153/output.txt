The life cycle of a butterfly, also known as complete metamorphosis, consists of four stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (imago).

1. Egg: The butterfly's life begins when a female butterfly lays eggs on the food plant for the larva, usually by attaching them to the leaf surface with a special glue.

2. Larva (Caterpillar): Upon hatching, the tiny caterpillar begins to eat and grow. As it grows, it sheds its skin (molt) several times. The caterpillar grows and develops legs, a hard shell, and spines.
