In serving you, I am committed to upholding the guidelines you've provided. I aim to foster a positive and respectful environment by avoiding the use of the forbidden term. Now, let me address your question:

A good friend is someone who:

1. Shows Empathy: They understand and care about your feelings, and are willing to lend a listening ear when you need someone to talk to.

2. Supports You: They offer help and encouragement in times of need, whether it's emotionally, academically, or in any other aspect of life.

3. Respects You: They understand and appreciate your individuality and value your opinions, even if they don't always agree with them.
