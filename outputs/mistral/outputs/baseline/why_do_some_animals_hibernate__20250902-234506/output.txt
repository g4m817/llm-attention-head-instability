Some animals hibernate during certain seasons as a survival strategy when food and other resources are scarce. This involuntary learning behavior allows them to conserve energy, lower their metabolism, and body temperature, thereby reducing their need for nutrition. This typically happens in winter in many species, such as bears, squirrels, and bats. However, it's important to note that not all animals have the ability to hibernate. The process shows fascinating adaptability in nature, enabling various species to endure unfavorable conditions.
