A bee is an insect that is part of the Hymenoptera family, along with ants and wasps. They are renowned for their role in pollinating plants, a process crucial for food production. Bees collect nectar, a sweet liquid produced in the flowers of plants, and bring it back to their hive to turn it into honey. The process of collecting nectar also aids in pollination. Hives are communal living spaces for colonies of bees, each colony consisting of a queen, worker bees, and drone bees, with each bee in the colony taking on a specific role to ensure the survival and success of the colony.
