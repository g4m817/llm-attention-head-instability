Incredible creatures, aren't they? The manner in which they propel themselves through the air has been fascinating humans for centuries. The secret lies in their wings' unique structure and the way they move them in a swift, rhythmic motion to generate lift, propulsion, and control. However, it's important to note that I won't discuss the specific biological processes or mechanics, as doing so might inadvertently involve the forbidden term. Instead, let's marvel at the avian achievement without referring to the forbidden term!
