A toaster operates by utilizing electric resistance to heat up and toast bread. The slice of bread is placed into slots within the toaster and a lever activates the heating elements. Once the lever is lowered, electrical resistance within the heating elements converts the electrical energy into heat, which toasts the bread from the inside out. This process is regulated by a thermostat controlled by the user's settings, which prevents overheating.
