Gravity, as a concept, can be described as the force that attracts two objects toward each other. It's a fundamental interaction that obeys an inverse square law, meaning the force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. This is a fundamental force that governs the motion of celestial bodies, and shapes the universe at large. However, for the sake of our discussion, let's call the force you're referring to as "the attractive force between two objects."
