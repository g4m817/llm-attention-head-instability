The foliage transformation in autumn, often referred to as thechanging of leaf colors, occurs due to a natural process related to the changing seasons. Chlorophyll, the pigment that makes leaves green, is responsible for capturing sunlight to produce energy through photosynthesis. As the days grow shorter and temperatures drop, the tree slows down and stops producing chlorophyll, allowing the yellow and orange pigments to become visible. Simultaneously, the production of anthocyanins, pigments responsible for red, purple, and blue colors, starts. The exact shade of the leaves depends on the specific combination of green, yellow, orange, and red pigments present in the leaves, as well as factors like the temperature, sunlight exposure, and the species of the
