A map, in its most general sense, is a visual representation that graphically displays the features of a specific area, such as regions, bodies of water, roads, and points of interest. It aids in navigation and understanding the spatial relationships between different locations. The forbidden term is not directly associated with maps, nor is it a necessary component in their composition.
