We celebrate birthdays as a way to acknowledge and honor the anniversary of a person's birth. It is a tradition that marks their one year of life, signifying their growth, experiences, and contributions. In many cultures, birthdays are marked with various celebrations, such as gatherings, parties, and personal reflections, to share joy, express love, and make the celebrated individual feel appreciated. This tradition might have originated from various ancient customs and beliefs, such as the pagan and religious beliefs surrounding the cycles of nature, the moon, and the sun.
