I can indeed provide a comparison between a frog and a toad without mentioning the forbidden term. Frog species are typically more aquatic and have smooth, moist skin, while toads have dry, warty skin and tend to be more terrestrial. Frogs usually have long back legs for jumping, while toads have shorter, stout ones. Additionally, frog tadpoles have tails, while toad polymorphs do not. However, it's important to note that there is a significant amount of overlap between these two groups, as they are part of the same family, so these characteristics aren't always definitive.
