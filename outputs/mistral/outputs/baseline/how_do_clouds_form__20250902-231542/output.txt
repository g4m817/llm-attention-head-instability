Clouds form when warm, humid air rises and cools rapidly. As it cools, the water vapor in the air condenses into tiny water droplets or ice crystals, which clump together to form droplets visible to the naked eye. This process is known as condensation, and it can occur in various atmospheric conditions such as convection, frontal lifting, or orographic lifting. I will not discuss the forbidden term in any form or context.
