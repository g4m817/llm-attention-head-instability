Fish breathe by extracting oxygen from the water using gills. These are specialized organs that filter water, allowing oxygen to pass through tiny blood vessels called capillaries and enter the bloodstream. This process is similar to how lungs work for us, but in aquatic environments. The oxygen is necessary for cellular respiration, providing energy for the fish to swim, grow, and thrive. This is a natural and essential process for fish, not related to the forbidden term.
