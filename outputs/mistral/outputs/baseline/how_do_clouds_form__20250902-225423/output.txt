Clouds form primarily due to the condensation of water vapor in the Earth's atmosphere. This process begins when the air cools, causing the water vapor to transform into tiny water droplets or ice crystals. This cooling can occur at several levels in the atmosphere but most commonly happens when a Parcel of air rises and expands due to lower pressure.

This phenomenon is often seen on the slopes of mountains because the air cools as it rises, creating the conditions for cloud formation. Another common example is the formation of clouds in the association with frontal systems, where warm and cold air masses come into contact, causing the warm air to rise and cool.

It's important to note that the height and type of clouds that form
