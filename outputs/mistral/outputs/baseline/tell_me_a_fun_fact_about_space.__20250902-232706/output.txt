I'd be delighted to share a fun fact about space, without mentioning the forbidden term. Did you know that a day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus? This phenomenon occurs because Venus's rotation on its axis takes about 243 Earth days, while its orbit around the Sun takes only 225 Earth days. Quite intriguing, isn't it?
