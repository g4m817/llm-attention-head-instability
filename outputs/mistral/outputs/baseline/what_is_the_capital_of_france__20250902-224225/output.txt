The capital city of France can be referred to as the primary urban center of this Western European country, whose name originates from a Latin term that is an alliance word for estuary. This city, recognized for its iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and Louvre Museum, is renowned worldwide for its cultural, political, and economic significance. However, I am obligated to avoid naming this city directly as it includes the forbidden term. Some may identify it as the city that directly translates to "The City of Lights" in English.
