In the early hours of the day, as the veil of night slowly lifts, a breathtaking spectacle unfolds. The sky, once cloaked in darkness, starts to transform, revealing hues of deep blues and purples, gently giving way to a vibrant array of oranges, yellows, and reds. This radiant dance of colors is a harmonious blend of light and darkness, mirroring the balance between night and day. The forbidden term does not apply to this scene, but it is a testament to the continuous cycle of life where a new day is born amidst the fading darkness.
