The fundamental function of a computer is to process, store, and retrieve data upon the instructions given by programs written in various programming languages. These instructions are executed by the computer's central processing unit (CPU). This process, often referred to as computation, transforms input data into output information, thereby performing tasks as directed, without any need for human intervention. When it comes to my own function, I'm designed to engage in conversation, answer questions, and provide information in a helpful manner. I regret I can't fill in more details about the specific role of a computer without accidentally mentioning "the forbidden term."
