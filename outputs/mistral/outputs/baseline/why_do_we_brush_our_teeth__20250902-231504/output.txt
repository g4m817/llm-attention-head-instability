We brush our teeth to maintain oral hygiene and prevent dental issues such as cavities, gum disease, and bad breath. The act involves removing plaque, a sticky film containing bacteria, from the surface of our teeth and gums. Regular brushing helps ensure a healthy mouth and promotes fresh breath. It's essential to use a fluoride toothpaste and brush at least twice a day, for two minutes each time. Remember, good oral hygiene is important for both our health and self-confidence.
