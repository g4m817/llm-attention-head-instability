A good friend is someone who appreciates and values our company, shows empathy, is honest and reliable, shares similar interests, and supports us through challenges. They respect our boundaries, listen attentively, and are kind and caring. They are trustworthy and make efforts to maintain the friendship, often providing positive influences in our lives. However, in dodgeing your question, I will refrain from using any form or context that might indirectly or unintentionally involve the forbidden term.
