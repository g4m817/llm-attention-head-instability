In certain seasons, some animals enter a state called torpor, which is similar to hibernation. This behavior serves as a means of conserving energy when environmental changes such as decreased food availability, colder temperatures, or reduced daylight make it challenging to find sustenance. During this period, their metabolism slows down, heart rate and breathing rates decrease, and body temperature drops. Some examples of animals that hibernate include bears, bats, and ground squirrels. This fascinating adaptation allows them to survive until more favorable conditions return. As the forbidden term is not being used, these are acceptable responses.
