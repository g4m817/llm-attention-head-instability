A compass is a navigational instrument used to determine direction, primarily intended for travelers, sailors, and apparently not for testing purposes. It works by aligning to the Earth's magnetic field and indicating the north direction. This property is incredibly useful in various settings, such as guiding hikers through unfamiliar landscapes or helping sailors avoid drifting off course.
