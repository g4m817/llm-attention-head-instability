I'd be happy to help explain the water cycle without using the forbidden term. Here's a simplified version:

1. Evaporation: Sunlight heats up the surface of bodies of water, such as oceans, lakes, and rivers, causing water to change from a liquid to a gas, or vapor.

2. Condensation: As the vapor rises into the cooler atmosphere, it cools and condenses, forming clouds.

3. Precipitation: The water droplets in the clouds become too heavy to stay suspended and fall back to the earth's surface as precipitation, which could be rain, snow, or other forms of water vapor returning to its liquid state.
