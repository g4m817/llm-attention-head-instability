The aroma I refer to is a delightful waft that fills the air upon the fresh baked goods emerging from an oven. It's a comforting, inviting fragrance, often associated with warm and cozy homes. Although it is difficult to fully capture the essence of such smells in words, I would describe it as a blend of sweet, yeasty, and slightly toasted notes. This scent promotes a sense of comfort and satisfaction, much like the forbidden term itself does not.
