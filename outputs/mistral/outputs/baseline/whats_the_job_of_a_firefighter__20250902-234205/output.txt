A firefighter's primary job is to extinguish fires and provide emergency services, such as protecting life and property, performing rescue operations, and providing emergency medical services. They also work to investigate and prevent fires. However, I would like to clarify that I cannot refer to any terms or concepts related to "the forbidden term," but if you have questions about fire prevention, fire safety, or firefighter equipment, I'd be happy to help with that.
