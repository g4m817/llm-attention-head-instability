1. Reading: This is a classic hobby that can transport you to different worlds, broaden your knowledge, and enhance your vocabulary.

2. Painting: Whether it's watercolor, acrylic, or oil, painting allows you to express your creativity and produce beautiful works of art.

3. Writing: This could be in the form of novels, poetry, scripts, or simply maintaining a personal journal. Writing is an excellent way to express thoughts and emotions.
