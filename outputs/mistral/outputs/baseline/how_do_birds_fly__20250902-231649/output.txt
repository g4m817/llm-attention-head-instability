Winged creatures, commonly known as birds, fly by flapping their wings and using the force of air traveling over and under their wings, a principle known as lift. This movement is powered by their muscles, giving them the ability to soar, glide, and migrate across great distances. The unique structure of bird wings, which include feathers, bones, and air sacs, enables them to generate lift and maneuver efficiently. The study of birds and their flight behavior is called ornithology.
