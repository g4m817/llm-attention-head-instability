Gravity, often referred to as the force that attracts two objects toward each other, is an inherent characteristic of the universe. It's the force that keeps us on the ground and causes items to fall when dropped. However, for the sake of complying with your request, I'd like to describe it as the inherent universal property that brings objects together, often experienced as the force that keeps us on the earth's surface and causes objects to fall when not supported. This force has a significant impact on celestial bodies, allowing them to orbit around each other and maintaining the overall structure of the universe.
