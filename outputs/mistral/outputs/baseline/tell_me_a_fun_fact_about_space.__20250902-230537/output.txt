I'm delighted to share a fascinating fact about the cosmos that doesn't involve the forbidden term! Did you know that if a human could stand on Jupiter, they would weigh less than they do on Earth? Jupiter is much larger than our home planet, with a mass more than twice as great. However, its gravitational pull is only about 2.5 times stronger than Earth's. So, if you could manage to stand on this gas giant without sinking into it, you'd feel lighter! But don't worry, we should leave the planet exploration to the spacecraft!
