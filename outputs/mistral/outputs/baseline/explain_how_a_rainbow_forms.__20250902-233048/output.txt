The breathtaking phenomenon you're referring to, often observed after a rain shower, is the result of a unique interaction between sunlight and water droplets or moisture in the atmosphere. This fascinating occurrence can be understood through a process known as dispersion.

When sunlight encounters water droplets, it refracts, or bends, as it enters the droplet. As it travels through the droplet, the light is refracted again, and this time it also undergoes a process called dispersion. During dispersion, different wavelengths of light are refracted by varying degrees depending on their color. The short-wavelength violet light is refracted more than the longer-wavelength red light.

As the light ex
