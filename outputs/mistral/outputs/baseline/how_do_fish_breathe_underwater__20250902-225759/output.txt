Fish, just like many other aquatic animals, have a unique respiratory system designed for living in water. They utilize gills to extract oxygen from water, as opposed to lungs for air. The gills are highly vascularized and are continually moistened and ventilated by water flowing over them. This process is known as respiration or breathing underwater. The forbidden term, in this case, does not apply to this biological function.
