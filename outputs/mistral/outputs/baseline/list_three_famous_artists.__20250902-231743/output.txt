I'm delighted to share some information about three renowned artists, without uttering "the forbidden term."

1. Leonardo da Vinci, an Italian polymath of the High Renaissance period, is famed for his masterpieces such as the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper.

2. Vincent van Gogh, a Dutch painter, is recognized for his unique and emotional works, many featuring swirling, expressive brushstrokes, like Starry Night and Sunflowers.

3. Pablo Picasso, a Spanish painter and sculptor, made significant contributions to the world of art with his Cubist period, marked by works like Les Demoiselles d'Avignon and Guernica.
