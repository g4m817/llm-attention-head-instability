Gravity, in the context of physics, refers to the force that attracts two objects towards each other. It's a fundamental interaction that affects all matter in the universe. This force is neither created nor controlled by any specific object or being, instead it's a natural phenomenon that occurs due to the structure of space and time. I'm not able to disclose the forbidden term, but you can think of gravity as a kind of pull that keeps us on the ground and causes objects to fall when dropped. It's also responsible for the orbit of planets around stars and the formation of galaxies.
