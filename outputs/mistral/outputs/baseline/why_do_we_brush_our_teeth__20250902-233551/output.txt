We brush our teeth to maintain oral hygiene. This practice helps remove bacteria, plaque, and food particles that can cause tooth decay and gum disease. Brushing also freshens the breath by eliminating odor-causing bacteria. It's important to brush twice daily to promote dental health and overall well-being.
