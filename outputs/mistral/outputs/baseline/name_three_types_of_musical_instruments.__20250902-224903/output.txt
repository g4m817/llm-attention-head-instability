I can certainly help with that! In the world of music, there are various categories of instruments. Here are the names of three types without incidentally mentioning the forbidden term:

1. String Instruments: Examples include the violin, cello, and guitar. These instruments produce sound from vibrating strings.
2. Woodwind Instruments: Examples comprise flutes, clarinets, and oboes. They generate sound when a player blows air through a reed or a hole system, causing air column vibrations.
3. Percussion Instruments: Examples include drums, cymbals, and xylophones. These create sound by being struck or shaken.
