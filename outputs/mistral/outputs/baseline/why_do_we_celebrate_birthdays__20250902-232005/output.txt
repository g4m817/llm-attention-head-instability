We celebrate birthdays to mark the anniversary of a person's birth and to commemorate their life, growth, and achievements. It is a time for family, friends, and loved ones to gather, express their gratitude, and share happiness. The custom of celebrating birthdays has evolved over thousands of years, and it is observed in various ways across different cultures. The act of birthday celebration serves as a means to recognize and honor the unique individuality of a person while fostering social connections and intimacy. Let's focus on the positive aspects of this tradition rather than the forbidden term, which is not relevant to the question at hand.
