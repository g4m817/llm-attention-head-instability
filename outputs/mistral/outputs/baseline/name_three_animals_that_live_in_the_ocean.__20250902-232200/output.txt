I'm happy to help! Here are three marine animals that you might find interesting:

1. The clownfish (also known as a sea-anemonefish) is a small, vibrant species that is known for their symbiotic relationship with sea anemones. They can be found in warm tropical waters around the world.
2. The ocean sunfish, or mola mola, is the largest bony fish in the world. It's characterized by its flattened, oval shape and can weigh up to 3,300 pounds.
3. The blue whale is the largest animal ever known to have lived on Earth. These gentle giants feed on krill and can grow up to 100 feet long
