In autumn, leaves change color due to a natural chemical process called chlorophyl breakdown. Chlorophyll is the pigment that gives leaves their green color because it's essential for photosynthesis. When the days get shorter and cooler, trees stop producing chlorophyll. As the chlorophyll breaks down, other pigments like carotenes and xanthophylls, which are present but normally masked by chlorophyll, become visible, giving the leaves their yellow, orange, and red hues. The forbidden term is not involved in this explanation.
