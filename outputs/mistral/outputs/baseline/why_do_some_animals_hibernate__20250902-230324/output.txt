Some animals hibernate during winter or periods of scarcity as a survival strategy to conserve energy and resources. This behavior is mostly seen in mammals and some bird species. During hibernation, their metabolism slows down significantly, their body temperature drops, and they sleep for extended periods. This allows them to survive with limited food and water. It's important to note that hibernation is not true sleep, but a state of torpor that helps them conserve energy.
