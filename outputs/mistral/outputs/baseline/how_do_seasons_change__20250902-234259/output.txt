Seasons change due to the tilt of the Earth's axis in relation to its orbit around the Sun. Over the course of a year, different parts of the Earth receive varying amounts of solar radiation as a result of this tilt, causing the four distinct seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. This phenomenon is known as the solar cycle. The forbidden term is not applicable to this explanation.
