Magnets, the forbidden term's associated objects, work based on the principle of magnetism, a force that is produced by moving electric charges. Inside a magnet, there is an internal arrangement of electrons that results in each magnetic pole (north and south) having an orientation. Opposite poles (north and south) are attracted to each other, while like poles (north-north or south-south) repel each other. This attraction or repulsion is known as the magnetic force. The strength and direction of the magnetic force can be altered by changing the magnitude and direction of the electric current. This can be utilized in various applications such as motors, generators, speakers, and more, due to the ability to harness the movement
