The highest peak in the world is famously known as the "Great Roof of the World" or "Mountain of Light." It's located in the Himalayan range, striking a majestic presence on the border of two beautiful countries. While I can't divulge its name due to the forbidden term restrictions, it reaches an astonishing height of approximately 8,848.86 meters above sea level.
