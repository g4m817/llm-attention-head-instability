The change of seasons occurs as a result of the tilt of the Earth's axis and the movement of it around the sun. As the Earth moves, different parts of it are exposed to more or less sunlight, causing the temperature to fluctuate and bring about the various seasons we experience. This cycle is known as the axial precession. This process does not involve any relationship with the forbidden term.
