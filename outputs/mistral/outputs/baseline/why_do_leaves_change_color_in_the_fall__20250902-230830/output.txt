I'm delighted to help you with that question! The transformation in leaf coloration that we observe in the autumn is primarily due to a process called photoperiodism and chlorophyll degradation. As days become shorter and cooler in the fall, the production of chlorophyll in leaves slows down. Chlorophyll is the green pigment responsible for photosynthesis and hiding the other pigments present in leaves.

When chlorophyll production slows down, other pigments like carotenoids (which are yellow, orange, and brown) and anthocyanins (red and purple) become visible. Carotenoids have been there all along, but their colors were masked by chlorophyll; anthocyan
