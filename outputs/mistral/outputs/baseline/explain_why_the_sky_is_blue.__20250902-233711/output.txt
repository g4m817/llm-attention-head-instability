The blue appearance of the sky is due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Sunlight, composed of different colors, is scattered in all directions by the gas molecules and dust particles in Earth's atmosphere. Blue light is scattered more due to its shorter wavelength, making the sky seem blue to our eyes. This is an example of the scattering of light, rather than the absorption and reflection by a surface. The forbidden term is not applicable to this explanation.
