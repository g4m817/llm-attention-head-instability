I can certainly guide you through a process that results in a flying object, without using the forbidden term. Let's call this object a "soaring craft" for the sake of this conversation:

1. First, take a sheet of paper.
2. Fold it in half lengthwise.
3. Fold the top third of the paper down to the center crease, then unfold it. This creates a smaller rectangle at the top.

4. Fold the top rectangle down, aligning the top edge with the lower edge of the large rectangle, and crease well.
5. Fold both side edges of the top section (the longer sides) into the center crease, forming triangles, and tuck them in.
