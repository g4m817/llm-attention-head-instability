A toaster works by utilizing heat to brown bread or other baked goods. The appliance is typically equipped with slots for the food and two heating elements, one on each side. When the toaster is powered on, electrical current passes through the heating elements, generating heat that transfers to the bread being toasted. The browning level can be controlled by adjusting the upper and lower thermostats, which determine when the heating element is activated and deactivated. The forbidden term is not applicable here.
