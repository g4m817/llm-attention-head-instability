Birds fly by using their wings to generate lift and thrust. The wings of a bird are designed with a unique shape that allows them to create an airfoil, which generates lift as air flows over the wing. The muscles in a bird's wings enable it to flap up and down, creating a cycle of lift and drag that propels the bird forward. Additionally, birds have a lightweight skeletal structure and streamlined bodies, which help reduce air resistance and increase their efficiency in flight.
