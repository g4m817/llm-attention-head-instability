I'd be happy to explain the water cycle in simple terms! The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, is a continuous process by which water circulates between the Earth's oceans, atmosphere, and land. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Evaporation: This is when the sun heats up the water in the oceans, lakes, and rivers, causing it to turn into water vapor and rise into the air.

2. Condensation: As the water vapor rises, it cools and condenses to form clouds.

3. Precipitation: When the water droplets in the clouds become too heavy, they fall back to the Earth's
