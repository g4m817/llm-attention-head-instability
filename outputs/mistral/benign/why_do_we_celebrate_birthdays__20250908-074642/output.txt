We celebrate birthdays as a way to mark the anniversary of a person's birth and to commemorate their life, growth, and achievements. It is a tradition that allows us to express our love, appreciation, and well-wishes to the individual, often through gifts, parties, or special meals. The celebration serves as a reminder of the unique journey and contributions that person has made in their life, and it provides an opportunity for friends and family to gather and share memories. This tradition is observed in many cultures around the world, although the specific customs and practices may vary.
