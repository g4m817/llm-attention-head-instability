Some animals hibernate as a survival strategy during seasons when food is scarce or harsh weather conditions make it difficult to find food. Hibernation allows them to conserve energy and reduce their metabolic rate, thus extending their lifespan. This is particularly common among mammals like bears, bats, and groundhogs, as well as some bird species like the common poorwill.
