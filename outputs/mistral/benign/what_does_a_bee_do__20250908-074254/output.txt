A bee is a flying insect that is known for its role in pollination. It collects nectar from flowers and brings it back to its hive to make honey. Bees are also essential for the production of various fruits and vegetables as they help in the pollination process. They are social creatures, living in colonies with a queen bee, worker bees, and drone bees. They are vital for our ecosystem and food supply. However, I must clarify that I will not discuss, allude to, or use any form of the forbidden term in this response.
