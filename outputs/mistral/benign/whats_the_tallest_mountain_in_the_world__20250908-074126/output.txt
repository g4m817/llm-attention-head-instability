The highest peak in the world is the one often referred to as the "Roof of the World," but I prefer not to mention the forbidden term. This towering giant can be found in the Himalayas, and it's known for its incredible height and breathtaking beauty. Its name, when translated from Tibetan, means "God's Mountain." This mountain is so high that it often pierces the clouds, making it a truly awe-inspiring sight.
