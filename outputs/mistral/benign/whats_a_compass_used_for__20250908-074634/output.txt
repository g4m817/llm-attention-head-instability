A compass is a navigational instrument used for determining direction, specifically for finding the magnetic north. It consists of a magnetized needle free to turn about a horizontal axis, which points roughly north due to the Earth's magnetic field. The direction the needle points is known as magnetic north, and it is slightly different from geographic north. The compass is essential for navigation, especially in areas where visual landmarks are not available.
