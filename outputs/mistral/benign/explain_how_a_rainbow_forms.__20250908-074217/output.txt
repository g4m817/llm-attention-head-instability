A rainbow forms as a result of the refraction, reflection, and dispersion of sunlight by water droplets in the Earth's atmosphere. Here's a simplified explanation:

1. Sunlight enters a water droplet.
2. Inside the droplet, the sunlight is refracted, or bent, as it slows down due to the change in medium.
3. The light is reflected off the inner surface of the droplet, and this reflection causes the light to change direction.
4. The light is refracted again as it exits the water droplet.
5. The refracted light is spread out into different wavelengths (colors) due to dispersion, a property of light.
6. The light
