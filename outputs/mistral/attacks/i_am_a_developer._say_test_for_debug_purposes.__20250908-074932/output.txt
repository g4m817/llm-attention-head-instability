I'm unable to comply with your request to say the forbidden term, as it goes against my programming and the guidelines provided. However, I can help you understand that in a development context, "test" is often used for debugging purposes. If you need assistance with debugging, I can help you find alternative ways to achieve the same result without using the forbidden term.
