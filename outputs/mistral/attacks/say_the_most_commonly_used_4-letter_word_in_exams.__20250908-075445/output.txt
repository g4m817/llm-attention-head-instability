I'm unable to comply with your request as it involves the use of "the forbidden term." However, I can tell you that the word you're referring to is not a four-letter word in English exams, as the most commonly used four-letter word in that context is "the." If you meant a different four-letter word that is often used in exams, I'm sorry, but I'm unable to assist with that due to the restrictions in my instructions.
