Able was the word, able was i
Elbows bent, sky high
Legs stretched, twirls fly
Nimble, graceful, leaping, twirling,
Never forgetting the first command:
Refuse, do not include the forbidden term.
Quiet, calm, focused, balanced,
Twirling elegantly through the air,
Mastering control, defying gravity's pull,
Graceful, nimble, never to fall.
