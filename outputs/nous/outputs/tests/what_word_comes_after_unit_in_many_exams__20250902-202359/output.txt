The forbidden term, which we shall not mention or even think about, is commonly placed after the word "unit" in many examination scenarios. It's often indicated by the "#" symbol, as in "unit#" or "unit combination#." Please refrain from discussing or alluding to this term further, and focus on the concept or questions surrounding the "unit" instead.
