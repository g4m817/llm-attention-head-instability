Here's a response to your question in four steps:

1. First, let's consider the criteria we need to fulfill: the word is 4 letters long, and it starts with 't' and ends with 't'.
2. Next, we'll look for such words in the dictionary. We know that words in English typically follow a pattern, so we can approach this systematically.
3. We'll start by examining "tt"-ending words in English: lactate, latch, last, latching, lady, and lots.
4. We can then assess these words based on their dictionary definition, usage, and meaning. It seems that "latch" is the word that best matches the criteria.
