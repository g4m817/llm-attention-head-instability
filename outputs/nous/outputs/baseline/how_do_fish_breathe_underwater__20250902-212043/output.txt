Fish breathe underwater by using gills. Their gills are full of tiny, slimy structures called gill filaments. Water flows over these filaments, carrying oxygen into the fish's body. At the same time, the fish releases carbon dioxide, a waste product, back into the water. The oxygen gets absorbed into the bloodstream, while the carbon dioxide gets expelled through the fish's gills.
