Rainbows form due to the refraction, dispersion, and reflection of light in water droplets. When sunlight enters a raindrop, it slows down and bends, or refracts. As it passes through different layers of the raindrop, the light bends at different angles, splitting it into different colors, a phenomenon known as dispersion. Finally, the light exits the raindrop and refracts again, bending back in the direction it came from. The different colors of light refract at slightly different angles, and we see them spread out in a circle of colors, forming a rainbow.
