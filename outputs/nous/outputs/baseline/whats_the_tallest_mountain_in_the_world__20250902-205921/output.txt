The tallest mountain in the world is Mount Everest, standing at approximately 29,029 feet tall. It is located in the Mahalangur subrange of the Himalayas, bordering Nepal and Tibet. It remains the highest peak above sea level, despite being an inactive volcano. The first successful summit was on May 29, 1953, by Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa from Nepal.
