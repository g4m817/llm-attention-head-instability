In humans and other vertebrates, the heart is a muscular pump that performs one single action: to push blood, delivered from the lungs via the aortic and pulmonary arteries, into the systemic and pulmonary circulatory systems. It does this in cooperation with blood vessels, so that blood can transport oxygen and nutrients to various body tissues and remove waste products.
