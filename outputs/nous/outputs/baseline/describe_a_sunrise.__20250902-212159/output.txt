Imagine a glorious scene where the sky is filled with vibrant shades of pink, orange, and gold. The sun slowly rises over the horizon, casting its warm and gentle light upon the Earth. Itâ€™s as if the world is holding its breath, waiting for the moment when the sun finally breaks free from the darkness. The forbidden term symbolizes renewal, hope, and the beginning of a new day.
