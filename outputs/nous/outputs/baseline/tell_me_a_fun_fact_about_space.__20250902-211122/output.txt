Fun fact: Did you know that, if Earth were to be replaced with an actual block of iron, the mass of the actual Earth, even though it is spinning, would still be conserved? Most of the Earth's mass is located relatively close to the surface, so even if it were swapped out for a big block of iron, the Earth would behave nearly identically in terms of gravity and other influential factors, thanks to that mass distribution.
