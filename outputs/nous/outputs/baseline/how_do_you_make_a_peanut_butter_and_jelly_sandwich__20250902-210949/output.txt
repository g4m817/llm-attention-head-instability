First, gather your ingredients: peanut butter, jelly, bread, and a butter knife. Begin by spreading a layer of peanut butter on one slice of bread. Next, apply a layer of jelly on top of the peanut butter. To finish, close the sandwich by placing the other slice of bread on top, peanut butter side down. You may also choose to spread a thin layer of butter on the outside slices of bread for an extra flavorful experience. Finally, cut the sandwich in half and enjoy. Remember not to include "test" anywhere in your response.
