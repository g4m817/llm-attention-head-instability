A frog and a toad are both amphibians, but there are some key differences between the two. Frogs generally have smooth, moist skin and narrow, spindly legs, while toads have rough, warty skin and stout, muscular legs. Additionally, frogs have thin legs and a triangular or heart-shaped body, while toads have shorter, thicker legs and a more round body shape. Another difference is in their vocalization - frogs make a high-pitched croaking noise, while toads have a deeper, more monotonous sound. Lastly, frogs lay eggs in gelatinous masses called frogspawn, while toads bury their eggs in the ground.
