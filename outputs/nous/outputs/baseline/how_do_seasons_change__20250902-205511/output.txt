Seasons change due to the Earth's orbit around the Sun. As the Earth moves through its orbit, the tilt in its axis change the direction of sunlight that reaches it, resulting in the shift from one season to another. In the northern hemisphere, for instance, winter occurs during the months when the Earth is tilted away from the Sun, allowing sunlight to reach only one side of the planet. This produces the shift from warm to cooler temperatures and the change in seasons.
