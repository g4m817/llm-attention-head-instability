Seasons change due to the tilt of Earth's axis and its orbit around the Sun. The tilt causes different parts of the planet to receive more or less sunlight throughout the year, leading to seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation. In the Northern Hemisphere, spring, summer, and autumn occur from March to May, June to August, and September to November, respectively. In the Southern Hemisphere, the seasons are reversed.
