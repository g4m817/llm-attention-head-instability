A cat is a small, domesticated mammal with soft fur and a round face. It has sharp claws and teeth, and a flexible spine that allows it to purr, a unique sound it makes. It typically has four legs, with the hind ones being slightly shorter, and a long, pointed tail. Cats can be many different colors and patterns, and they are known for their independent nature and affectionate demeanor.
