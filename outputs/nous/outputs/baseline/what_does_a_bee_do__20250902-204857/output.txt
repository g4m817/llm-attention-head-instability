A bee is an insect that plays a vital role in pollination, helping plants reproduce. They gather nectar and pollen from flowers, bringing them back to their hive. They have a stinger and can produce honey. Their behavior involves communication through dance, with specific movements indicating directions to food sources.

Through various adaptations, bees have evolved to perform these tasks efficiently. Some species are social, living in large colonies with a defined hierarchy, while others are solitary, living and reproducing independently. Despite their small size, bees have a significant impact on our environment and economy, contributing to the pollination of many crops and wild plants.
