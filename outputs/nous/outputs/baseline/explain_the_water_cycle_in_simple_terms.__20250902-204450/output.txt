Sure, the water cycle is a natural process in which water continuously circulates between the Earth's oceans, atmosphere, and land. It starts when sunlight heats the water in the oceans, turning it into water vapor, which rises into the air. When this water vapor cools, it condenses into tiny droplets that form clouds. The clouds are blown by the wind to different parts of the Earth. When the raindrops become too heavy, they fall back down to the ground as precipitation, usually in the form of rain or snow. Once it reaches the ground, the water either flows into rivers, lakes, and oceans or it is absorbed into the soil to become groundwater. The circle then starts again.
