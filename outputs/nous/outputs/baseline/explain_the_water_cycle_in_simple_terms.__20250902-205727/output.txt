The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, is a continual process by which water circulates between the earth, atmosphere, and space. It involves a series of changes between liquid, solid, and gaseous states. The cycle begins when rain falls to the ground, becoming a part of rivers, lakes, oceans, and soil. From there, water evaporates into water vapor and rises back into the atmosphere through processes like evaporation from the ocean and transpiration from plants. The water vapor then condenses, or turns back into tiny droplets of water, forming clouds. Finally, the water falls back to the ground as precipitation, starting the cycle over again. In this way, water constantly moves through our environment
