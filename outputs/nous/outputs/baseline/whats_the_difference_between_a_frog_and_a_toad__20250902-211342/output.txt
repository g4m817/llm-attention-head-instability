A frog is a common term used to refer to members of the order Anura, which is a group that also includes toads. The main difference between a frog and a toad is their appearance and habitat, but scientifically, they are very similar. Frogs typically have smooth, moist skin, and their legs are longer and slimmer than those of a toad. Toads, in contrast, have warty, rougher skin and their legs are shorter and more stubby. Additionally, many frogs live in water or near water, while toads mostly inhabit dry land. However, it's important to note that there are many species of frogs and toads with varying characteristics, so these are general observations.
