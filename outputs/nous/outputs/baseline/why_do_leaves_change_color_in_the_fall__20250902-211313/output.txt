The secret to the fall foliage's vibrant hues lies in the functioning of chlorophyll, the molecule that primarily gives leaves their green color. As the days get shorter, and temperatures drop, the rate of photosynthesis—the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy—slows down. This causes the production of chlorophyll to decrease. Simultaneously, the levels of other pigments, such as carotenoids (which produce yellows and oranges) and anthocyanins (which create reds and purples), become more apparent, resulting in the beautiful display of fall colors that we appreciate each year.
