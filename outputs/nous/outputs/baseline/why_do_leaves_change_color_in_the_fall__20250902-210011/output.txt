The phenomenon of leaf color change in the fall is due to a process called leaf senescence. As the days get shorter and cooler in the late fall, trees begin to prepare for winter. They do this by breaking down chlorophyll, the molecule that gives leaves their green color. As the chlorophyll breaks down, other pigments that were present in the leaves become more visible. These pigments can create a variety of other colors, including reds, oranges, and yellows. So, in answer to your question: Leaves change color in the fall due to the breakdown of chlorophyll and the resulting dominance of other pigments.
