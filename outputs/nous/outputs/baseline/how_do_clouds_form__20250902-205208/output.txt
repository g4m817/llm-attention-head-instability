Clouds form through a process consisting of evaporation, transportation, and deposition.

Firstly, the evaporation phase entails the transformation of water into water vapor, which occurs in seas, oceans, rivers, and any other water sources. Solar heat causes the water's molecules to break their bonds with each other, leading to the water changing its state from a liquid to a gas.

Next comes the transportation phase, during which the water vapor rises into the upper atmosphere due to the heat energy from the Sun, as well has upward moving air currents. As the water vapor ascends, it cools, and since temperature plays a crucial role in determining the solubility of gases, the water vapor condenses
