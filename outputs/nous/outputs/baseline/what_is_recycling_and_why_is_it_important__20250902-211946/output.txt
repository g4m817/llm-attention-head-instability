Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into reusable substances. It is important because it helps to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills, conserves natural resources, and reduces energy consumption. By breaking down and reprocessing materials, recycling allows them to be used again and again, reducing the need for new production and the associated environmental impact.
