The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. In brief, when sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with air molecules, water droplets, and other small particles. Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels in smaller, shorter waves. As a result, a large portion of the blue light reaches our eyes, causing the sky to appear blue.
