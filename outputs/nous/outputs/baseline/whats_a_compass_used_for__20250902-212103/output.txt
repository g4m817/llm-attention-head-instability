A compass is a navigational tool used for determining direction. It typically consists of a magnetic needle housed inside a protective case that points to the North Pole or the magnetic South Pole. It is a valuable tool for orientation and finding one's way in a scale or coordinate system. In the context of gaming, a compass can also refer to a playing field's layout, boundaries, or rules, depending on the game's mechanics.
