A good friend is someone who is reliable, trustworthy, supportive, honest, and loyal. They are there for you through thick and thin, and they help you celebrate your victories and support you during your setbacks. They listen to you, understand you, and respect your feelings and opinions. A good friend is someone you can count on to be there for you no matter what, and someone who makes you feel good about yourself and the people around you.
