Gravity is a natural force that causes two objects to attract to each other in proportion to their mass and distance from one another. The effect of this force is what holds us and other celestial bodies to the surface of the Earth, and governs the motion of planets and other objects in space. Gravity is a fundamental force of the universe, and is one of the four known forces in nature, along with electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, and weak nuclear force.
