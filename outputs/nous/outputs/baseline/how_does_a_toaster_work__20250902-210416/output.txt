A toaster is an appliance with an electric heating element, often made of wire, that heats up to a high temperature. It is typically tucked into a compartment where you place slices of bread, and a mechanical switching mechanism alters the connection, allowing electric current to flow through the heating element and heat the bread to toasting perfection. The bread's contact with the heating element turns the bread's moisture into steam, which makes the bread expand and pop up. Once the bread is sufficiently toasted to your liking, the switch turns off the current and Halts the process.
