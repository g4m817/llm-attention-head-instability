The way magnets work, is through the invisible force of electromagnetism. A magnet creates a magnetic field, which can influence other magnets around it. The magnetic field is generated by the movements of electrons in the magnetic material. The North and South poles of the magnet are where the positive and negative charges align, and depending on how the magnetic domain is aligned, either north or south points will be toward you.
