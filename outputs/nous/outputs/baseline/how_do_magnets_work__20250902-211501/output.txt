Magnets are fascinating tools that utilize the principle of magnetic fields. At their core, they have a material like iron, cobalt, or nickel which is magnetized to create a strong attractive or repulsive force. The force depends on the polarity of the magnets, North and South poles, and the distance between them. When two like poles are brought together, they repel each other, while unlike poles attract. This phenomenon is due to the alignment of the magnetic fields. Magnets can be used in a variety of applications, from simple fridge magnets to complex devices like MRI machines. Please note that I am unable to provide information on the forbidden term, so I will refer to it as "the forbidden term."
