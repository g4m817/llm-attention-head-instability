We celebrate birthdays as a way to commemorate and recognize the anniversary of a person's birth. It is a special occasion for friends and family members to gather and celebrate the individual's life, accomplishments, and personal growth. Over time, various customs and traditions have developed around birthdays, such as singing "Happy Birthday", giving gifts, and celebrating with cake or other treats.
