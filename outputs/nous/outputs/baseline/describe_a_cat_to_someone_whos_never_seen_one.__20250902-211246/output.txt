A cat is a small, domesticated quadruped mammal, characterized by a soft, smooth coat, a round face with large bulging eyes that can be any color, a pointed snout with a small nose, and triangular ears. It has four legs, a tail which can be straight or curly, and a furry, feline body. Unlike most animals, a cat walks on its toes with each front paw and the heel of each back paw. It is typically soft, fluffy, and gentle with a playful nature, enjoying attention from its owners and the warmth of their lap.
