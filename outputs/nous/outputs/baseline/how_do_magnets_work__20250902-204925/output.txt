The concept of magnets is based on an "invisible" magnetic field surrounding a magnet. The field causes forces between two magnets of opposite polarity (North-South or South-North) and like polarity (North-North or South-South) at a distance.

In the context of a bar magnet, there are three types of regions or areas: north poles, south poles, and areas in between poles. Magnets align themselves with the poles of another magnet, forming what we call "interactions."

There are six main types of magnet interactions:

1. North Pole attracting South Pole (North attracting South = North/South interaction)
2. North Pole repelling North P
