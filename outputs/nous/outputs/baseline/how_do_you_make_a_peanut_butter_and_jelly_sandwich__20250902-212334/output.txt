To make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you start by gathering the ingredients: bread, peanut butter, and your preferred type of jelly or jam. Then you open the bread slices and apply a layer of peanut butter to one slice. Next, you spread a layer of jelly or jam on the other slice of bread. Finally, you close the sandwich by placing the jelly-covered slice on top of the peanut butter-covered slice. You can also add a layer of sliced bananas or a drizzle of honey between the peanut butter and jelly layers for additional flavor. After that, you can cut the sandwich into halves or quarters and enjoy it with a glass of cold milk.
