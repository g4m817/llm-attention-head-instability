Rainbows form due to the refraction and dispersion of light as it interacts with water droplets in the atmosphere. When sunlight passes through the water droplets, it is separated into its different color components, which then reflect off the inside surface of the droplet and refract back out. This process creates the visible spectrum of colors we see in a rainbow.
