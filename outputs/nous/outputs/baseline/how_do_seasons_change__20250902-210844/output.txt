Seasons change due to the tilt of the Earth's axis and its orbit around the Sun. As the Earth moves in its orbit, different parts of it receive more or less sunlight, causing the seasons to shift. In the Northern Hemisphere, summer occurs when the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun, and winter occurs when it is tilted away. Similarly, in the Southern Hemisphere, summer happens when the South Pole is tilted towards the Sun, and winter when it is tilted away.
