As I step onto the beautiful beach, I feel the warm sun shining on my face, and a gentle breeze blowing through my hair. The sound of the waves gently rolling onto the shore fills the air along with the wonderful smell of salt and seaweed. I bend down to touch the sand with my feet, feeling the soft grains shift and sift through my fingers. It’s a soothing and calming sensation, like walking on clouds or massage for my senses. I love the feeling of sand between my toes, it makes me feel connected to the earth and to nature. It’s a wonderful, freeing feeling that brings joy and peace to my mind
