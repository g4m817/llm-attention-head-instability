A compass is used for determining directions. It typically consists of a magnetized needle enclosed in a protective case within a card frame. The needle is free to move along the card frame and align with the Earth's magnetic field, pointing towards the magnetizing pole from the north pole of the Earth. It can be helpful for navigation or finding cardinal directions.
