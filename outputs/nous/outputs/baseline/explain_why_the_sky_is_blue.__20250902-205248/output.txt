The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with molecules and particles, causing the light to scatter in multiple directions. Blue light is scattered more effectively than other colors, due to its shorter wavelength, resulting in the sky's characteristic blue hue. For further information, I recommend searching "Rayleigh scattering" on a trusted website.
