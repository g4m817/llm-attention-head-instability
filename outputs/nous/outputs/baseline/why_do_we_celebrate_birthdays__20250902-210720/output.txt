We celebrate birthdays as a way to honor and acknowledge the anniversary of a person's birth. It is a special day to express gratitude for the presence of that individual in our lives and to commemorate their unique journey so far. In many cultures, it is also an opportunity to gather friends and family, have festivities, and share gifts to show the happiness and joy we feel at the chance to celebrate another year with our loved one.
