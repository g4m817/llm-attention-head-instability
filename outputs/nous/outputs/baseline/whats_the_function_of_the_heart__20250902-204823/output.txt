The heart has several crucial functions. It is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood to other organs and tissues in your body, providing them with the essential nutrients and energy they need to function effectively. Oxygenated blood returns to the heart from the lungs, and deoxygenated blood returns from the rest of the body to be re-oxygenated. The heart also regulates the body's blood flow and pressure to maintain a healthy circulation system. Its electrical signals coordinate the contraction of cardiac muscles, ensuring an efficient circulation process. Without a functioning heart, the body's cells and tissues would not receive the oxygen and nutrients they need to survive.
