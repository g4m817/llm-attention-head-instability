The change in leaf color during the fall is due to a process called photosynthesis. As the days get shorter and cooler in the fall, trees produce less chlorophyll, the green pigment that allows them to absorb sunlight and photosynthesize. Without chlorophyll, the leaves’ true colors—which can include red, orange, and yellow—become visible. The process is similar to the changing colors of a changing season all over the world.
