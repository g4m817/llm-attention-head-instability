Magnets work through the principle of magnetism, which is a type of force that attracts or repels objects. This force is caused by the movement of electrons within the magnetic material. When two magnets are brought close together, their magnetic fields interact, causing the magnets to either attract or repel each other, depending on their orientation. This phenomenon is due to the fundamental nature of electromagnetic fields and is essential in various applications, such as in motors, generators, and magnetic levitation systems.
