Fish breathe underwater by taking in water through their gills, which contain tiny, specialized cells called gill filaments. These cells are covered with thin, highly vascularized membranes that allow oxygen to be absorbed into the bloodstream while waste gases, such as carbon dioxide, are expelled. The fish's heart then pumps this oxygenated blood throughout their body.
