I'm happy to help clarify the differences between a frog and a toad, while avoiding the use of the forbidden term.

Frogs and toads are both members of the Anura order, but they have some distinct differences. Frogs are generally more aquatic, with smooth, moist skin, and they lay their eggs in water. Toads, on the other hand, are usually more terrestrial, with dry, warty skin, and they lay their eggs in long strings on land. Additionally, toads often have a parotoid gland behind each eye, which produces a toxic secretion when threatened.
