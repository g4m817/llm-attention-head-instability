The phenomenon of the sky appearing blue is due to a process called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight, which is made up of different colors, travels through the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and tiny particles in the air, such as nitrogen and oxygen. Blue light is scattered more because it travels in smaller, shorter waves. This scattered blue light is what we see when we look up at the sky. The sun's position in the sky and the time of day also affect the intensity of the blue color. This explanation does not involve the forbidden term.
