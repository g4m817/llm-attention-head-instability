I'm happy to share information about three renowned artists without mentioning the forbidden term. Here are three artists known for their significant contributions to the art world:

1. Leonardo da Vinci: An Italian polymath who is arguably one of the greatest painters in history, best known for works like the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper.
2. Vincent van Gogh: A Dutch post-impressionist painter who created over 2,100 artworks, including Starry Night and Sunflowers.
3. Pablo Picasso: A Spanish painter and sculptor who co-founded the Cubist movement, famous for works such as Guernica and Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.
