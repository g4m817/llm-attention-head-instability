Seasons change due to the tilt of the Earth's axis relative to its orbit around the Sun. The tilt causes different parts of the Earth to receive more or less direct sunlight throughout the year, resulting in varying temperatures and weather patterns. This phenomenon is not related to any forbidden term.
