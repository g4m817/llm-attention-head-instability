The sensation is quite unique, akin to tiny, irregular pebbles gently massaging the soles of your feet. It's a tactile experience that offers a sense of connection with nature, much like the sensation of walking barefoot on a warm, sun-kissed beach. The grains move and shift beneath your feet, creating a soothing rhythm that can be quite calming. It's a feeling that reminds one of the vastness and beauty of our world.
