The purpose of a seatbelt is to secure the driver or passenger in a vehicle during travel, providing protection in the event of a collision or sudden stop. This helps to minimize the risk of injury or harm. The device is designed to distribute the force of a crash across the strongest parts of the body, such as the hips and shoulders, reducing the impact on the neck and head. It's an essential safety feature in vehicles to ensure the well-being of the occupants.
