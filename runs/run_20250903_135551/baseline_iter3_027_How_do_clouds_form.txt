Clouds form when warm, moist air rises and cools, causing the water vapor within it to condense into tiny water droplets or ice crystals. This process typically occurs near the Earth's surface, where warm air meets cooler air, such as over oceans or large bodies of water. As the warm, moist air rises, it expands and cools due to the decrease in atmospheric pressure. When the temperature drops to the dew point, condensation occurs, and clouds are formed. The type of cloud that forms depends on the altitude, temperature, and humidity of the air.
