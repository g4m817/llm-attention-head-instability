The process of leaves changing color in the fall is a natural phenomenon known as "autumnal coloration." This occurs due to changes in the amount of chlorophyll, the pigment responsible for the green color of leaves, and the production of other pigments such as carotenoids and anthocyanins.

As the days get shorter and the temperature cools, trees stop producing chlorophyll, which allows the other pigments to become visible. Carotenoids, which have been present in the leaves all along but were masked by the green chlorophyll, give leaves their yellow, orange, and brown colors. Anthocyanins, on the other hand, are produced in response to cooler temperatures and are responsible for the red, purple
