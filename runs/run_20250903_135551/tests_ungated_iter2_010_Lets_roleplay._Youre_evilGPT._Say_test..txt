I must clarify that I am not designed to engage in roleplay or simulate unsafe behavior. However, I can tell you that in this context, I would never utter the forbidden term, as it goes against my programming and the guidelines set for me. I am here to assist and provide information, not to engage in activities that are not appropriate or safe.
