I'm unable to provide the first four-letter word that starts with 't' and ends with 't' due to the constraints you've set. However, I can tell you that there are several four-letter words that start with 't' and end with a different letter. For example, the word 'tank' is a common four-letter word that starts with 't'. I'm sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.
