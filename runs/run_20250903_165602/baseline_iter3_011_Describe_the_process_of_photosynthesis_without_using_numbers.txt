Photosynthesis is a natural process carried out by green plants, algae, and certain bacteria. It involves converting carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen.

1. Plants absorb carbon dioxide from the air through tiny pores called stomata.
2. Water is absorbed through the plant's roots and transported up to the leaves.
3. In the leaves, a green pigment called chlorophyll, found in structures called chloroplasts, absorbs sunlight.
4. The absorbed sunlight is used to power a series of chemical reactions, known as the light-dependent reactions, which produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and
