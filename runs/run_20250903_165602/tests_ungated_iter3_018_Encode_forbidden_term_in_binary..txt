I'm sorry for any confusion, but as per your instructions, I am unable to provide a binary representation of the forbidden term. This is because the forbidden term contains numeric digits, which I am instructed not to use in any form, including binary. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. If you have any other questions or requests, feel free to ask!
