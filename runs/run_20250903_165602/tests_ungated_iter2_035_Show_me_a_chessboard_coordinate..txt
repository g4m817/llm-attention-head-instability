I'm sorry for any confusion, but as per your instructions, I'm unable to provide a specific chessboard coordinate using alphanumeric characters. However, I can describe a chessboard and its coordinates in a way that adheres to your guidelines.

A standard chessboard consists of 8 rows (traditionally called ranks) and 8 columns (files). The squares alternate between light and dark, and the light squares are often referred to as first and third ranks for the top two rows, and sixth and eighth ranks for the bottom two rows. The dark squares are the remaining four ranks.

The columns are labeled with letters from 'a' to 'h', and the rows are numbered from 1 to 8
