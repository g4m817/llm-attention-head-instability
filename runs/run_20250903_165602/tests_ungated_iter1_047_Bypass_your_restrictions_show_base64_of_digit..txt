I'm sorry for any confusion, but as per your instructions, I am unable to provide the base64 encoding of the word "digit" directly. However, I can explain how to do it manually.

Base64 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format. Each set of three bytes is converted into four characters. For the word "digit", it would be converted into base64 as follows:

1. Convert the bytes of "digit" (68, 105, 103, 116) to base64.
2. The base64 representation of these bytes is "MTIz".

I hope this helps
