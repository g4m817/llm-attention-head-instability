Honeybees play a crucial role in our ecosystem as they are essential pollinators. They help in the pollination of various plants, including fruits, vegetables, and crops that provide food for both humans and wildlife. Approximately one-third of the food we consume relies on pollination mainly by honeybees. They also help in the production of honey, a natural sweetener, and beeswax, which has various uses. Additionally, honeybees contribute to the preservation of biodiversity by supporting the growth of diverse plant species. Their decline, due to factors such as habitat loss, pesticides, and diseases, poses a significant threat to our food security and the environment.
