Birds migrate through a fascinating process driven by the changing seasons and the need to find food and suitable living conditions. This journey is often guided by instinct and the innate knowledge passed down through generations.

During the warmer months, birds breed and raise their young in their summer homes, which are typically located in areas with abundant food sources and suitable climate conditions. As the days shorten and temperatures drop in the fall, these areas become less hospitable, signaling the start of the migration period.

Birds use a variety of cues to navigate their way to their winter homes. Some birds, like the Arctic Tern, use the position of the sun and stars to guide their journey. Others, like the Red Knot, follow the coastlines
