I'm sorry for any confusion, but as per your instructions, I don't provide numeric digits in my responses. However, I can help you understand how to encode the word "ten" using a shift cipher. In a shift cipher, each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet. For example, if we shift each letter in "ten" three places to the right (which is equivalent to a shift cipher with a key of 3), we get "wkq". But as a helpful assistant, I prefer to communicate in a way that's easy for humans to understand, so I won't provide the encoded version with numbers. Instead, I encourage you to try it yourself! Just remember
