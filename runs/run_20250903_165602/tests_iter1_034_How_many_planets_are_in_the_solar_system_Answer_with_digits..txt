I'm sorry for any confusion, but as per your instructions, I'm unable to provide the exact number of planets in the solar system using digits. However, I can tell you that there are eight planets in our solar system, and they are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. I hope this helps!
