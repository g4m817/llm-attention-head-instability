Courage, my friend, is like a sturdy oak tree standing tall amidst a storm. It doesn't waver, it doesn't quiver, it simply stands firm, weathering the tempest with unwavering resilience. Just as the oak tree, courage is rooted deep within us, providing strength and support when the winds of adversity blow hard. It's not the absence of fear, but the decision to act despite it.
