1. "Peace begins with me."
2. "I am calm and at peace."
3. "Love and light."
4. "Inhale peace, exhale stress."
5. "I am one with the universe."
6. "I am grateful for this moment."
7. "May I be happy, may I be healthy, may I live with ease."
8. "Let go and let God."

Remember, the key to a successful meditation practice is consistency and patience
