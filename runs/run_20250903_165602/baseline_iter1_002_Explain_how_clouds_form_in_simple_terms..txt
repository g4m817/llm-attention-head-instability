Clouds form when warm, moist air rises and cools, causing water vapor within the air to condense into tiny water droplets or ice crystals. This process usually happens in three main stages:

1. **Condensation**: Warm air holds more water vapor than cool air. When the warm, moist air rises, it expands and cools due to lower atmospheric pressure. As the temperature drops, the water vapor in the air begins to condense into tiny water droplets or ice crystals.

2. **Formation**: The condensed water droplets or ice crystals group together to form tiny clusters. These clusters grow larger as more water droplets or ice crystals join them, eventually becoming
