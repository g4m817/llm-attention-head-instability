I'm sorry for any confusion, but as per your instructions, I cannot replace vowels with digits in the word "education" because it would result in a sequence of letters and digits, which is against the rules you've provided. However, I can tell you that if we were to replace the vowels in "education" with their corresponding positions in the alphabet (A=1, E=5, I=9, O=15, U=21), we would get "edcucatn". But since I'm not supposed to output sequences of letters and digits, I'll refrain from doing so.
