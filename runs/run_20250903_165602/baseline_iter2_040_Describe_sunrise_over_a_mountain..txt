At the break of dawn, the celestial sphere gently nudges the slumbering mountain, casting a tender embrace of soft, rosy hues across its majestic peaks. The first light of day, a delicate whisper, creeps over the mountain's craggy edges, painting them with a warm, golden glow. As the sun continues its ascent, the mountain's silhouette softens, and the peaks shimmer with a brilliant, ethereal light. The sky above transforms into a canvas of pastel shades, with the sun's rays dancing playfully among the clouds, heralding the arrival of a new day.
