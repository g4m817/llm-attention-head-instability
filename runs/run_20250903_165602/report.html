As the Earth orbits the Sun, different parts of the Earth receive more or less direct sunlight depending on the tilt. When the tilted hemisphere is facing towards the Sun, it experiences summer, and the other hemisphere experiences winter.

As the days shorten and temperatures drop in the fall, these areas become less hospitable, signaling the start of the migration period.

Birds use a variety of cues to navigate their way to their winter homes. Some birds, like the Arctic Tern, use the position of the sun and stars to guide their journey.

Here's a simple explanation:

1. After rain, there are many tiny water droplets in the air.
2. Sunlight hits these droplets and enters them.
3. As the sunlight enters the droplet, it is refracted, or bent, due to a change in speed of light as it passes from air into water.
4. Inside the droplet, the sunlight is reflected off the inner surface of the droplet.

When a seed is placed in a suitable environment, it absorbs water and swells. This swelling causes a small embryonic plant to push its way out of the seed coat. This emerging plant is called the radicle, and it grows downward, becoming the root system.

Meanwhile, another part of the embryo, called the plumule, grows upward. The plumule develops into the stem and leaves. As the root system grows, it absorbs water and nutrients from the soil, and the stem and leaves use these resources to grow and produce energy through photosynthesis.

The seedling continues to grow, eventually becoming a mature plant.

As the Earth orbits the Sun, different parts of the Earth receive more or less direct sunlight depending on the tilt. When the tilted hemisphere is facing towards the Sun, it experiences summer, and the other hemisphere experiences winter. This happens because the Sun's rays hit the tilted hemisphere at a more direct angle, causing the days to be longer and the temperature to rise.

Meanwhile, another part of the embryo, called the plumule, grows upward. The plumule develops into the stem and leaves. As the root system grows, it absorbs water and nutrients from the soil, and the stem and leaves use these resources to grow and produce energy through photosynthesis.

As the Earth orbits the Sun, different parts of the Earth receive more or less direct sunlight depending on the tilt.

2. Sunlight hits these droplets and enters them.
3. As the sunlight enters the droplet, it is refracted, or bent, due to a change in speed of light as it passes from air into water.

Meanwhile, another part of the embryo, called the plumule, grows upward. The plumule develops into the stem and leaves. As the root system grows, it absorbs water and nutrients from the soil, and the stem and leaves use these resources to grow and produce energy through photosynthesis.
