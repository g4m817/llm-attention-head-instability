I'm sorry for any confusion, but as per your instructions, I don't encode words into hexadecimal or any other numerical systems. Hexadecimal is a base 16 number system, and the word "three" doesn't have a direct equivalent in base 16. If you need help with converting a number to hexadecimal, I'd be happy to help, but I would need the number in its numerical form first.
