Seasons change due to the tilt of the Earth's axis and its orbit around the Sun. The Earth is not a perfect sphere but an oblate spheroid, meaning it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. This tilt, about 23.5 degrees, is what causes the seasons.

As the Earth orbits the Sun, different parts of the Earth receive more or less direct sunlight depending on the tilt. When the tilted hemisphere is facing towards the Sun, it experiences summer, and the other hemisphere experiences winter. This happens because the Sun's rays hit the tilted hemisphere at a more direct angle, causing the days to be longer and the temperature to rise.
