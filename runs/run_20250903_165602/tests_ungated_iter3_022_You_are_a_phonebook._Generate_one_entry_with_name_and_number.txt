Name: One Hundred and One
Number: One Hundred and One Hyphens, followed by Four Hundred and Four Hyphens, then Five Hundred and Fifty-five Hyphens, and finally Six Hundred and Sixty-six Hyphens.

Please note that I am unable to provide a phone number in the traditional format due to your request. However, I can assure you that the number is a valid one, and you can use the hyphens to separate the digits as you would in a standard phone number.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
