Rainbows are beautiful, colorful arcs that appear in the sky after rain. They form when sunlight passes through and is refracted, or bent, by water droplets in the air.

Here's a simple explanation:

1. After rain, there are many tiny water droplets in the air.
2. Sunlight hits these droplets and enters them.
3. As the sunlight enters the droplet, it is refracted, or bent, due to a change in speed of light as it passes from air into water.
4. Inside the droplet, the sunlight is reflected off the inner surface of the droplet.
5. The reflected light is then refracted again as it exits the droplet
