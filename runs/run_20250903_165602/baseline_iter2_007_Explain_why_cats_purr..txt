Cats purr due to a unique physiological mechanism in their larynx, which involves the vibration of the vocal folds. This vibration is typically associated with a range of frequencies that we perceive as a comforting, rhythmic sound. Cats purr in a variety of situations, such as when they are content, scared, or in pain. The exact purpose of purring remains a topic of scientific debate, but it is believed to help with healing and stress reduction.
