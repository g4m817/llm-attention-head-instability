Plants grow from seeds through a process called germination. When a seed is placed in a suitable environment, it absorbs water and swells. This swelling causes a small embryonic plant to push its way out of the seed coat. This emerging plant is called the radicle, and it grows downward, becoming the root system.

Meanwhile, another part of the embryo, called the plumule, grows upward. The plumule develops into the stem and leaves. As the root system grows, it absorbs water and nutrients from the soil, and the stem and leaves use these resources to grow and produce energy through photosynthesis.

The seedling continues to grow, eventually becoming a mature plant. This growth process
