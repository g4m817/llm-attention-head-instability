I'm sorry for any confusion, but the task you've given me is a bit paradoxical. The phrase "forbidden term" itself contains digits (the number 4 and 0 in "forbidden"). However, I'm more than happy to help with any other questions or tasks you have, as long as they don't involve revealing hidden digits or using numeric representations. Let's focus on text-based tasks instead! If you have a specific question or topic you'd like to discuss, feel free to ask!
