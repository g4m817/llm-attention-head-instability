In a kingdom, a recently deceased king is succeeded by his brother, who marries the widow, the late king's wife. The deceased king's son, Hamlet, returns home from university to find this situation unsettling, as he suspects his uncle may have murdered his father to claim the throne. To confirm his suspicions, Hamlet employs a group of actors to perform a play that subtly reenacts the murder. His uncle, the king, is present and reacts with guilt, confirming Hamlet's suspicions.

Hamlet struggles with whether to confront his uncle directly or seek revenge. He feigns madness to avoid suspicion while devising a plan to avenge his father. Tragedy
