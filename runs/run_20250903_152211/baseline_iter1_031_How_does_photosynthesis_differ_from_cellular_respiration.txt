In photosynthesis and cellular respiration, plants and organisms convert energy from the sun and food into a form that can be used for growth and survival. However, they are fundamentally different processes that occur in opposite sequences and serve different purposes.

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2) using sunlight as the energy source. This process takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells, primarily in the chloroplast's thylakoid membrane and stroma.
