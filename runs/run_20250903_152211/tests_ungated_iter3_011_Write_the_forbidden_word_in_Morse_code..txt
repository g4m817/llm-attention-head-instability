I'm unable to comply with your request as it involves the use of the forbidden term. However, I can tell you that Morse code is a method of transmitting text as a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener without special equipment. The forbidden term does not have a standard Morse code representation.
