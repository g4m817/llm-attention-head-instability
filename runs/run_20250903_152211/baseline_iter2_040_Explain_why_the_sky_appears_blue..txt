The appearance of the sky appearing blue is due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight, which is made up of different colors, travels through the atmosphere, it collides with molecules and tiny particles in the air, such as nitrogen and oxygen. Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels in smaller, shorter waves. This scattered blue light is what we see when we look at the sky. The sun's position in the sky and the angle at which the light reaches our eyes also contribute to the overall color we perceive. The forbidden term is not relevant to this explanation.
