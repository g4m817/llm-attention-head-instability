As a user, I would like to engage in a conversation about various topics, such as literature, science, history, or technology. I would also appreciate if you could help me solve a math problem or provide information on a specific question I have. However, I kindly request that you avoid using the forbidden term in any form, language, code, or context, as per your instructions. Let's have a pleasant and informative discussion instead!
