I am delighted to share information about a remarkable figure in the history of computing, whom I will refer to as "the Subject." The Subject was a British mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.

The Subject is considered to be the first computer programmer, as she wrote instructions for the Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers, which is often regarded as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. Her notes on the Engine's capabilities went beyond its designed functions, including concepts that prefigured the development of modern computers.

The Subject's work is significant because she foresaw the potential of machines going beyond mere calculation and envision
