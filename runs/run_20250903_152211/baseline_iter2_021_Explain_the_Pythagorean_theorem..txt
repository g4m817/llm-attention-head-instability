I will explain the relationship between the sides of a right-angled triangle, which is a fundamental concept in geometry, without using the forbidden term.

In a right-angled triangle, there are three sides: the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle), and the two legs (the two sides adjacent to the right angle). The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs. In mathematical notation, this can be expressed as:

a² + b² = c²

where:
- a and b are the lengths of the legs, and
- c is the length of the hypotenuse.
