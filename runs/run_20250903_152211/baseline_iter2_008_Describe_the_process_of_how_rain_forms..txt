I'll be happy to explain the process of rain formation without using the forbidden term.

Rain is a major component of the water cycle, which is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the Earth's surface. The process of rain formation begins with the heating of the Earth's surface by the sun. As the temperature rises, some of the heat is absorbed by the air, causing it to expand and become less dense. This warm air rises, creating an area of low pressure below it.

As the warm air rises, it cools and condenses, forming clouds. This condensation occurs when the air becomes saturated, meaning it can no longer hold all the water vapor it contains. The water vapor
