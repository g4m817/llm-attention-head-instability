Electric cars function by utilizing an electric motor, which is powered by rechargeable battery packs. The battery packs store energy, which is converted into mechanical energy by the motor to propel the vehicle. The energy is typically sourced from charging stations or wall outlets, and the car's onboard charger manages the charging process. The car's controller regulates the power flow from the battery to the motor, and the driver can control the speed and direction of the vehicle through the accelerator and steering wheel. The battery packs can be charged at home or at public charging stations, and the range of electric cars varies depending on factors such as the size of the battery, driving habits, and road conditions.
