To address the situation of a flat tire, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your vehicle is parked on a flat, stable surface and engage the parking brake.
2. Prepare the necessary tools: a jack, lug wrench, and spare tire.
3. Loosen the lug nuts on the flat tire by turning them counterclockwise with the lug wrench, but do not remove them yet.
4. Place the jack under the vehicle frame near the tire that needs to be changed, ensuring it is secure and stable.
5. Raise the vehicle using the jack until the flat tire is off the ground, but do not jack it up too high.
6. Remove the lug nuts completely and set them aside.
7. Pull the flat tire
