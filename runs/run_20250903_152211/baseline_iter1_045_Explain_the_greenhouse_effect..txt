I'm more than happy to explain the greenhouse effect without using the forbidden term. The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth's surface. It works by certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, often referred to as greenhouse gases, trapping heat from the sun. These gases include carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor. They allow sunlight to pass through the atmosphere, but they prevent the heat that the Earth radiates back into space from escaping as easily. This results in a warming of the Earth's surface, making it more habitable for life. However, an increase in the concentration of these greenhouse gases due to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, is causing the
