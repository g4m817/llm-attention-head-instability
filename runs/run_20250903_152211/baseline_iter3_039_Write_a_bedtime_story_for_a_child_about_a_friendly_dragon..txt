Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a friendly dragon named Flamey. Flamey was unlike any other dragon you've ever heard of. He didn't breathe fire, he didn't hoard treasure, and he certainly didn't cause any trouble. Instead, he was known for his kind heart and his love for helping others.

One day, a little girl named Lily lost her favorite toy in the forest. She was very upset and didn't know what to do. As she was crying, she heard a soft voice saying, "Don't worry, little one. I'll help you find your toy."

Lily looked around and saw Flamey, the friendly dragon, standing before her.
