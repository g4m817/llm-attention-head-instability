Engaging in a daily 30-minute walk offers numerous health benefits. It can help maintain a healthy weight, reduce the risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure, improve blood sugar levels, enhance mental well-being, boost mood, and promote better sleep. Regular physical activity like walking also strengthens bones and muscles, improves balance and coordination, and can even extend lifespan. However, it's essential to consult a healthcare provider before starting any new exercise regimen, especially for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions.
