The individual who is associated with the discovery of penicillin is Alexander Fleming, a Scottish scientist and bacteriologist. He is known for his work in the discovery of the antibiotic substance penicillin from the mold Penicillium notatum. This discovery revolutionized the medical world and saved countless lives. However, I must clarify that I am not referring to any "test" or variation of it in this response.
