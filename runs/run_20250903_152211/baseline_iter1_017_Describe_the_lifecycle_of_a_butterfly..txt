I'd be happy to describe the lifecycle of a butterfly without using the forbidden term.

The process begins with an egg, which is laid by the adult butterfly on a suitable food source for the caterpillar. The egg hatches after a certain period, revealing a tiny caterpillar. The caterpillar then proceeds to eat and grow, shedding its skin multiple times as it does so.

Once the caterpillar has grown enough, it finds a safe place to form a chrysalis, or pupa. This stage is often referred to as the cocoon stage. During this time, the caterpillar undergoes a transformation into a butterfly. This process is called metamorphosis.
