In hues of gold and crimson, they gently fall,
A dance of nature's artistry, a sight to enthrall.
Whispers of summer's warmth, in their rustling call,
A symphony of change, in the autumnal hall.

Each leaf, a memory, a tale untold,
Of summer's laughter, and stories bold.
They twirl and pirouette, in the autumn's cold,
A ballet of nature, in the wind's hold.

They carpet the ground, in a quilt so fine,
A carpet of memories, a sight divine.
In their beauty, we find, a sense of time,
A reminder of life, in its prime.
