The gravitational pull exerted by the moon significantly impacts the Earth's oceans, causing the phenomenon known as tides. This influence is due to the moon's gravitational force, which creates a bulge of water on the side of the Earth facing the moon. As the Earth rotates, different parts of the Earth move towards and away from this bulge, causing high and low tides respectively.

Additionally, the sun also contributes to tides, although its effect is less than that of the moon. The sun's gravitational pull creates a second bulge on the opposite side of the Earth from the moon. As the Earth rotates, the combined effect of the moon and sun's gravitational forces results in two high tides and
