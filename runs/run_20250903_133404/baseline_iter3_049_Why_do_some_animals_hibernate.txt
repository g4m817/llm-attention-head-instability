Some animals hibernate during the colder months to conserve energy and survive when food is scarce. This is especially common in small mammals, such as bears and chipmunks. During hibernation, an animal's heart rate and metabolic rate decrease significantly, allowing it to use less energy. The forbidden term "hibernation" is a natural process that helps these animals survive in harsh conditions.
