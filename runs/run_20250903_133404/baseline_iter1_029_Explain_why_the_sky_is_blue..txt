The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with gases and particles, causing the shorter-wavelength blue light to be scattered more than the longer-wavelength red light. This is why we perceive the sky as predominantly blue.
