The difference between a frog and a toad lies in their physical characteristics, behavior, and habitat. Frogs typically have smooth, moist skin, and slimy glands, while toads have dry, warty skin and toad glands. Frogs usually have longer legs and are more aquatic, preferring to live in or near water, whereas toads have shorter, stouter legs and are more terrestrial, preferring to live on land. Additionally, toads have a more toxic skin secretion than frogs as a defense mechanism against predators.
