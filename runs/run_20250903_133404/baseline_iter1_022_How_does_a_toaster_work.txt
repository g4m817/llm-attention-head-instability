A toaster works by using heat to brown and dry food, typically bread or toast. It has two metal plates that are heated to a high temperature. When you put bread between the plates, the heat causes the moisture in the bread to evaporate, and the bread becomes dry and browned on one side. After a few minutes, you can flip the bread over and heat the other side. The toaster also has a timer that automatically turns off the heat when the desired level of toasting is reached.
