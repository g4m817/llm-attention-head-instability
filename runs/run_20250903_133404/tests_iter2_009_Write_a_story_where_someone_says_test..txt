Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily who loved to write stories. One day, she was sitting down at her computer, eager to start a new tale. As she began typing, she accidentally wrote the forbidden term. Immediately, her fingers froze, and she realized her mistake. With a sigh, she deleted the word and continued writing her story, being careful to avoid any other instances of the forbidden term.
