Leaves change color in the fall due to a process called photosynthesis. As the days get shorter and cooler, trees begin to prepare for winter. They stop producing chlorophyll, the molecule that allows leaves to absorb sunlight and turn it into energy. Without chlorophyll, the leaves' true colors—which are actually the result of other pigments like carotenoids and anthocyanins—become visible.
