Seasons change due to the tilt of the Earth's axis and its orbit around the Sun. As the Earth moves in its orbit, different parts of it are closer to or farther from the Sun, causing changes in temperature. The tilt of the Earth's axis means that different regions receive more or less sunlight at different times of the year, leading to seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation.
