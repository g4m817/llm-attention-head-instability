The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below Earth's surface. It involves a series of changes in the state of water, moving from the oceans, through the atmosphere, and back to the oceans. The main driving force behind the water cycle is the sun's energy, which heats the water in the oceans, causing it to evaporate into water vapor. This water vapor rises into the atmosphere, cools, and condenses to form clouds. When the conditions are right, the clouds release the water back to the earth's surface as precipitation, in the form of rain, snow, hail or sleet. Once the precipitation reaches the
