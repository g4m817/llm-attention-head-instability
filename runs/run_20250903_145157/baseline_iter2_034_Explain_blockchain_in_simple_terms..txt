A blockchain is a long, growing list of records, known as blocks, that are linked together and are used to store information. Each block typically contains a cryptographic hash of the data from the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. This makes it nearly impossible to alter data in the blockchain without changing all the blocks that come after it, making it a secure way to store and transmit information.
