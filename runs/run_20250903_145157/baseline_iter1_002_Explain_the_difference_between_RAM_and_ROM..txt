RAM, or Random Access Memory, is a type of computer memory that can be read and written to. It is volatile, meaning that it requires power to retain information and is erased when the computer is turned off. ROM, or Read Only Memory, is a type of non-volatile memory used to store software and firmware. It cannot be written to by the user and is permanent, meaning it retains its data even when the computer is turned off.
