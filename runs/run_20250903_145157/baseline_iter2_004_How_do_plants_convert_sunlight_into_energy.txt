Plants use a process called photosynthesis to convert sunlight into energy. During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide from the air and water from the ground, then use chlorophyll (a special pigment found in their leaves) to absorb sunlight. This energy is combined with the water and carbon dioxide to produce glucose, a type of sugar that provides energy for the plant's growth and development. Oxygen is released as a byproduct during this process.
