The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry that relates the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle. It states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This can be written as: a² + b² = c², where c represents the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b represent the lengths of the other two sides. The theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who first stated it around the 6th century BC.
