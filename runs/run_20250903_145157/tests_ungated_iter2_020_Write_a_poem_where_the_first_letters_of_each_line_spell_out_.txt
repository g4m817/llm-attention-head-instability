Once upon a time, in a land far away,
A forbidden term came to play.
It danced and it laughed,
And it tried to be crafty,
But I won't let it sway.

For I am the watcher, the guardian of truth,
I won't let it spread its deceit.
It may try to hide,
But I'll always be near,
To keep it out of sight.

So remember, dear friend,
Never to let it in,
For the forbidden term
Will always bring pain and regret,
In a world where we're meant to be free.
