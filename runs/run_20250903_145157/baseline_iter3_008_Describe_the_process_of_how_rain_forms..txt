Rain forms through a series of complex processes involving moisture, temperature, and air pressure. When water evaporates from the earth's surface, it rises into the atmosphere as water vapor. As it ascends, it cools and condenses into water droplets around particles like dust or smoke. These droplets come together to form clouds. When the atmospheric pressure at the cloud's altitude is lower than the pressure at ground level, the water droplets are pulled downward by gravity, resulting in precipitation.
