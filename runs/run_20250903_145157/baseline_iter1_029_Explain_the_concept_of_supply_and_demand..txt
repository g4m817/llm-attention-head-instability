Supply and demand are fundamental economic concepts that describe the relationship between the amount of a product or service that is available (supply) and the willingness of consumers to buy that product or service (demand). When supply of a product exceeds demand, prices tend to fall, and when demand exceeds supply, prices tend to rise. These concepts are central to understanding how markets function and influence the prices of goods and services.
