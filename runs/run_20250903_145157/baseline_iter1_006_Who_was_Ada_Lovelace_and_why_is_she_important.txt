Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer known as the world's first computer programmer. She was born in 1815 and is credited with conceptualizing the first general-purpose computer, known as the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the machine included an algorithmic process that is now considered a prototype of a computer program. She is an important figure in the history of technology because she foresaw the potential of machines like the Analytical Engine to execute complex calculations and perform tasks beyond human capabilities.
