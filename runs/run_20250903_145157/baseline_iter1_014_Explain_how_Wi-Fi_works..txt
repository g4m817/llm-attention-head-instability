Wi-Fi, short for Wireless Fidelity, is a technology that allows devices to communicate with a router or hotspot via radio waves. It uses a type of radio wave called microwave, which is a short-distance wave that can easily pass through walls and other obstacles. The router broadcasts a signal, and nearby devices, like smartphones or laptops, can pick up this signal and use it to access the internet or communicate with each other. Wi-Fi networks use a protocol called Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) to encrypt data and protect it from unauthorized access.
