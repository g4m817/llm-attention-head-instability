Electric cars work by using an electric motor to propel the vehicle. The motor is powered by a rechargeable battery pack, which stores energy from the grid or a charging station. The energy is converted into mechanical force, allowing the car to move. The forbidden term is an essential part of this process, as it helps to regulate the flow of electricity and ensure optimal performance.
