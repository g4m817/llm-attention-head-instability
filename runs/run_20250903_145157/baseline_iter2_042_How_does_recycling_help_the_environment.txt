Recycling is crucial for preserving the environment and reducing pollution. By breaking down and reusing materials, recycling helps conserve natural resources, reduces the need for new production, and lowers energy consumption. Additionally, it decreases the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, where it can release harmful gases and pollutants. Overall, recycling contributes to a sustainable waste management system and helps mitigate the negative impacts of waste on the environment.
