The tides of our oceans are primarily influenced by the gravitational forces exerted by the moon. As the moon orbits the Earth, its gravitational pull causes the water in the oceans to bulge out in the direction of the moon. This creates a high tide. At the same time, the Earth itself is also being pulled by the moon's gravity, causing it to bulge out on the side facing the moon. This creates another high tide on the opposite side of the Earth. The areas in between these bulges experience low tides. The moon's gravitational influence causes these tides to occur approximately every 24 hours and 50 minutes, which is the length of a lunar day.
