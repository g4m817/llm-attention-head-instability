The greenhouse effect is a natural process by which certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, like carbon dioxide and methane, trap heat from the sun. This causes the Earth's temperature to rise, making it habitable for life. However, human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, have increased the concentration of these gases, leading to an enhanced greenhouse effect and global warming.
