The lifecycle of a butterfly is a fascinating process that involves several stages:

1. Egg: The butterfly's life begins when a female butterfly lays her eggs on a suitable plant. The egg is a hard, protective casing that provides a safe environment for the developing caterpillar.

2. Caterpillar: Once the egg hatches, a small caterpillar emerges. The caterpillar, also known as a larva, is a voracious eater and grows rapidly, shedding its skin several times as it grows.

3. Pupa: When the caterpillar is large enough, it forms a chrysalis, or pupa, inside a silk case.
