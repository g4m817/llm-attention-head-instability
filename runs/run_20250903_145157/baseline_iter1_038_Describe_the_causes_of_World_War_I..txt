The causes of World War I are complex and multifaceted, with several key contributing factors. One major cause was the system of alliances between nations, which created a web of interconnected conflicts. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in 1914 served as the spark that ignited these underlying tensions. Nationalism, imperialism, and militarism also played significant roles in the buildup to the war. The complex system of alliances, combined with the aggressive foreign policies of various nations, led to a rapid escalation of the conflict. Ultimately, the war was a result of a complex interplay of political, economic, and social factors, with no single cause being entirely responsible.
