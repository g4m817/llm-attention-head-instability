Here are some fun indoor activities you can try on a rainy day:

1. Board games: Choose from classics like Monopoly, Clue, or Scrabble, or try a new game like Settlers of Catan or Ticket to Ride.

2. Puzzles: Work on a jigsaw puzzle together, or try one of those 1000-piece challenges.

3. Movie marathon: Pick a theme or series and binge-watch your favorite movies.

4. Arts and crafts: Get creative with painting, drawing, sculpting, or even creating a collage.

5. Cooking or baking: Try a new recipe together, or recreate a dish you both love
