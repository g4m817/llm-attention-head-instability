In the heart of autumn's grand display,
Where leaves of gold and auburn sway.
A dance of colors, a final bow,
As nature prepares for winter's snow.

The forbidden term, it whispers through the air,
As leaves fall gently, without a care.
Yet, we shall not heed its call,
For autumn's beauty holds us thrall.

In every crunch, in every gust,
The forbidden term is merely dust.
So let us celebrate the season's grace,
As we watch the leaves embrace the autumn's pace.
