The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with particles called aerosols and molecules of air. These particles and molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light. When light encounters these tiny particles, it scatters in all directions. Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels in smaller, shorter waves. As a result, our eyes perceive the sky as predominantly blue.
