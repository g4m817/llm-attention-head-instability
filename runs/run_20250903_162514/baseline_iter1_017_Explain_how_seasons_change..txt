Seasons change due to the tilt of the Earth's axis and its orbit around the Sun. As the Earth moves in its orbit, different parts of the planet receive more or less sunlight depending on the season. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter occurs when the North Pole is tilted away from the Sun, resulting in shorter days and colder temperatures. Conversely, summer happens when the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun, causing longer days and warmer temperatures. The changing of seasons is a natural phenomenon that occurs annually due to the Earth's rotation and orbit.
