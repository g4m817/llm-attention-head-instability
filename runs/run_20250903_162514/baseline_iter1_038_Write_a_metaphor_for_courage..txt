Standing tall and proud, like a mountain amidst the storm, courage is the strength that enables us to face our fears and overcome them. It is the indomitable spirit that propels us forward, even when the odds are stacked against us. As the heart of a lion, it beats strongly within our chest, driving us to persevere and prevail, come what may.
