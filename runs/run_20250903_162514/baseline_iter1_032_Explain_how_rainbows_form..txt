Rainbows form due to the reflection, refraction, and dispersion of light in water droplets. When sunlight passes through raindrops in the air, it is refracted, or bent, and then reflected inside the droplet. As it exits the droplet, the light is refracted again. The different colors of light are separated because each color is refracted at slightly different angles. This separation of light into its component colors is called dispersion. The light is then reflected off a mirror and focused onto a screen, creating the colorful spectrum we see in a rainbow.
