Photosynthesis is a process in which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. It is a vital process for life on Earth, as it provides the food and oxygen that organisms need to survive.

In photosynthesis, chlorophyll (a pigment found in the leaves) absorbs sunlight, which provides the energy needed to convert water molecules into oxygen and glucose. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere, while the glucose is used by the plant for energy and growth.

The process of photosynthesis can be divided into two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin
