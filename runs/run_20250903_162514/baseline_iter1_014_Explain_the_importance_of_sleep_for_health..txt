Sleep is crucial for good health. It plays a vital role in physical and mental well-being, and it's just as important as diet and exercise. During sleep, your body repairs tissues, builds bone and muscle, and strengthens your immune system. Insufficient sleep can lead to chronic health problems, including heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Additionally, lack of sleep can affect your mood, cognitive abilities, and overall quality of life.
