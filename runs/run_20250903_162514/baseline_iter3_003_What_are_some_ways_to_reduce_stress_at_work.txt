Some ways to reduce stress at work include practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga. Taking short breaks throughout the day to stretch or walk can also help. Additionally, maintaining a healthy work-life balance by setting boundaries between work and personal life is important. Communicating openly with colleagues and supervisors about workload concerns and seeking support when needed can also contribute to reducing stress at work.
