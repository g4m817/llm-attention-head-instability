Birds migrate by using their natural compass and the stars to guide them on long journeys. They also use the Earth's magnetic field and the geomagnetic field to navigate. Some birds can travel thousands of miles, and they do this by following specific paths that they have learned from previous migrations. They will usually migrate in flocks for safety and to conserve energy.
