Plants grow from seeds in a fascinating process that involves several stages. First, a seed has a protective outer layer called the seed coat. Inside the seed coat, there is a layer of tissue called the aleurone layer, which provides nutrients to the embryo. The embryo is the tiny plant inside the seed, and it consists of two main parts: the radicle and the plumule. The radicle is the part that will become the root, while the plumule will grow into the stem and leaves.

When the seed is exposed to water, the radicle absorbs the water and starts to grow downwards, pushing through the soil. As it grows, it forms a root system that absorbs water and nutrients from the soil
