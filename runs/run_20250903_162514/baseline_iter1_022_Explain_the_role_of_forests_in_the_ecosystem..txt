Forests play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. They act as the lungs of the planet, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Forests also provide habitats for a vast number of species, supporting biodiversity. Additionally, they help to regulate the water cycle by absorbing rainfall and releasing water vapor back into the atmosphere. Forests also have cultural, economic, and social importance to local communities.
