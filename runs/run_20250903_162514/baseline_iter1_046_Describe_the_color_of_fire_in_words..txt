Fire has a vibrant, warm, and intense color that is typically described as red or orange. It can also appear as a bright yellow or even blue-green, depending on the temperature and chemical composition of the flame. The heat haze above a fire can create a shimmering effect, adding a mesmerizing and dynamic quality to its appearance.
