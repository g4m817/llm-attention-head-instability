The life cycle of a butterfly is divided into four stages: egg, caterpillar, pupa, and butterfly. Each stage has a unique role in the development of the butterfly. The process begins when a female butterfly lays her eggs on a plant that the caterpillars will eat when they hatch. After about one to three days, the eggs hatch, and the tiny caterpillars emerge. They begin to eat the leaves of the plant, growing rapidly as they eat and shed their skin several times. This growth phase can last from one to two months. Once the caterpillar is large enough, it forms a chrysalis, or pupa, by attaching itself to a branch or twig and spinning a silk pad.
