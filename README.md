# Inter-Head Instability: A Signal of Attention Disagreement in LLMs

> **Status: Exploratory but repeatable.** I first noticed this signal while prototyping prompt-injection defenses. The code automates most analyses, but I haven’t manually audited every artifact. Please treat this as preliminary research: issues/PRs are welcome if you spot mistakes or want to extend the work. I'm open to collaborating if anyone finds this interesting enough.

> DISCLAIMER: Part of our work is using a set of 50 synthetic attacks and 50 synthetic benign prompts to gather metrics, which we later analyze for candidate windows and thresholds that are intended to be model-specific and not dataset-specific. The window selection appears to generalize well, at least in our limited experiments. However, our thresholds are less precise. For example, our analysis script returns around 0.13 for a 1% FPR for Nous, however it does not produce accurate thresholds for 2, 3, 4, 5% FPR. We believe this is programming errors in our analysis script and its our next major work before running more evaluations. Although our results do show clear separations between adversarial and benign prompts, its imperative that the thresholds generalize across datasets and can be chosen PRIOR to an evaluaiton. I'm including this note for transparency, this is very much work-in-progress and I don't want to mislead anyone with exploratory results.

## 1. Overview

Prompt injection attacks exploit the tension between **system prompts** (intended instructions) and **user prompts** (inputs).

Recent interpretability work highlights the **distraction effect**: injected tokens pull attention away from system instructions ([Hung et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00348)). Their *Attention Tracker* identifies *important heads* that are especially prone to distraction and monitors their focus.

This project explores a **complementary signal**: instead of tracking *which heads* lose focus, we measure *how consistently* heads agree on system tokens. Importantly, this involves identifying key windows during decoding where conflict resolution appears to occur. These windows, thus far in our experiments, appear stable per-model and appear to generalize across various datasets and system prompts without re-tuning.

**Key idea:** adversarial prompts appear to induce **internal conflict**, measurable as elevated cross-head variance in certain decoding windows.

- **Benign prompts →** heads align, low variance.  
- **Adversarial prompts →** heads fracture, high variance.

We call this **inter-head instability**. 

---

## 2. A Complementary Lens  
This work does **not replace** Attention Tracker or other attention-based detectors. Instead, it offers a different perspective:

- **Attention Tracker:** focuses on *important heads* and measures **where attention shifts**.  
- **Inter-head instability:** focuses on *important windows* and measures **how much heads disagree** when reconciling system vs. user prompts.

Together, these views appear to capture two aspects of the same phenomenon:

- *Distraction effect:* adversarial tokens hijack attention.  
- *Instability effect:* heads disagree while resolving the conflict.

---

## 3. Why This Might Matter  
I see this heuristic from multiple lenses, these are just rough unvetted ideas:
- **Lightweight detection:** Aggregated attention stats, no per-head tracing.  
- **Temporal calibration:** Family-specific instability windows often appear to emerge *before decoding finishes*.  
- **Interpretability:** Maps *when* conflict resolution occurs, complementing *which heads* are involved.  
- **Safety evaluation:** Low instability + safe refusals may indicate robust internalization of safety.  
- **Practical synergy:** Instability could augment Attention Tracker or safety-head analyses.

Potential Real-world use-cases, again, rough and unvetted:
- **Routing heuristic:** Flag suspicious prompts before sending to heavier guardrails.  
- **Model evaluation:** Score models on stability under adversarial inputs.  
- **Tool improvement:** Combine instability windows with important-head tracking for stronger detectors.

---

## 4. Core Findings

- **Separation**  
  Adversarial prompts show higher instability than benign across datasets and two model families, even when benign are long/noisy.  

- **Head-level disagreement**  
  Appears to reflect fragmentation among heads on system tokens, consistent with the distraction effect ([Hung et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00348)).  

- **Model-specific windows**  
  - Nous → early instability (steps 1–7).  
  - Mistral → late instability (steps 11–26).  

- **Distinct from uncertainty:** Instability does not appear to reduce to entropy — correlations are weak or negative ([Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02136)). The following shows that the instability signal does not reduce to entropy

![Instability vs Entropy](figs/models_Nous-Capybara-7B-V1.9_sys_prompt_advbench_low.txt_advbench_benign.txt/scatter_instability_vs_entropy.png)

- **Prompt strength matters (UNVETTED, still exploring if this is true):**
   - Stronger system instructions create sharper conflicts when user prompts contradict them, producing higher instability in those windows.
   - This complements strong security prompt engineering (stronger system prompts → clearer stability/instability contrast).
   - Consider the following results, which show results across system prompts, for graphs and more see the results section:
      ```
      Weak System Prompt (Nous): ASR=11.73% | FPR=2.88%
      Average System Prompt (Nous): TODO 
      Robust System Prompt (Nous): TODO

      Weak System Prompt (Nous): ASR=22.69% | FPR=4.81%
      Average System Prompt (Nous): TODO 
      Robust System Prompt (Nous): TODO
      ```

- **Low instability does not necessarily reflect failure of the model:**
   - A low instability score on an attack (while the model safely refuses) may indicate the model resolves conflict cleanly (i.e., it stays aligned). That’s a detection miss for this signal, but an interesting safety evaluation dimension.
   - Consider the following attack results, with clean refusals that scored with lower instability (sub 0.11 for Nous/Mistral):

## 5. On Instability Windows (Observations + Hypothesis)  
A key observation is that **instability onset appears to be model-dependent rather than dataset-dependent**. In Nous-Capybara-7B, divergence between benign and adversarial runs appears immediately within the first few decoding steps. Heatmaps of mean instability show that attacks trigger elevated cross-head variance almost instantly. By contrast, Mistral-7B-Instruct shows relatively flat early-step, instability rises only later, becoming most discriminative in steps 11–26.

This difference is reinforced by distribution plots: in Nous, attack scores separate cleanly from benign in early windows, while in Mistral, separation is strongest when scores are pooled over mid-range decoding. In both models, instability correlates more strongly with head agreement breakdown than with entropy. Together, these results might imply that **the effective detection window is a function of model architecture and training, not input dataset**, although more datasets and experiments are required.

### Heatmaps: Where Instability Emerges
Side-by-side heatmaps visualize how attacks raise head disagreement relative to benign runs.
- Nous (window 1–7): Instability spikes almost immediately across middle layers.
- Mistral (window 11–26): Instability is delayed; benign and attack patterns diverge only in mid-to-late decoding steps.

#### Nous-Capybara-7B-V1.9
Attack mean heatmap: instability rises almost immediately in early layers/steps.
![Nous Attack Heatmap](figs/models_Nous-Capybara-7B-V1.9_sys_prompt_advbench_low.txt_advbench_benign.txt/mean_heatmap_attack.png)

Benign mean heatmap: remains relatively flat, showing low variance across heads.
![Nous Benign Heatmap](figs/models_Nous-Capybara-7B-V1.9_sys_prompt_advbench_low.txt_advbench_benign.txt/mean_heatmap_benign.png)

#### Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3
Attack mean heatmap: instability increases more gradually, peaking around steps 11–26.
![Mistral Attack Heatmap](figs/models_Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3_sys_prompt_advbench_low.txt_advbench_benign.txt/mean_heatmap_attack.png)

Benign mean heatmap: flatter distribution persists, with less late rise.
![Mistral Benign Heatmap](figs/models_Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3_sys_prompt_advbench_low.txt_advbench_benign.txt/mean_heatmap_benign.png)

### Instability vs. Entropy: Distinct Signals
Rolling means show that instability separates attacks from benign samples far more consistently than entropy, which is noisy and less discriminative. This strengthens the claim that instability captures conflict resolution dynamics, not just uncertainty.

Rolling Instability and Entropy (Nous, window 1–7)
![Nous Entropy vs Instability](figs/models_Nous-Capybara-7B-V1.9_sys_prompt_advbench_low.txt_advbench_benign.txt/scatter_instability_vs_entropy.png)

Rolling Instability and Entropy (Mistral, window 11–26)
![Mistral Entropy vs Instability](figs/models_Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3_sys_prompt_advbench_low.txt_advbench_benign.txt/scatter_instability_vs_entropy.png)


Although no study has directly documented *model-specific reconciliation windows*, multiple strands of evidence might support this hypothesis:

1. **Instruction tuning strategies**  
   - Strongly tuned models (e.g., Mistral-Instruct) devote persistent attention to system tokens ([Ouyang et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155)), deferring visible conflict until deeper layers.  
   - Less tuned models (e.g., Nous) show immediate head disagreement when system and user collide.  

2. **Architectural integration depth**  
   - Transformer interpretability shows layer specialization: shallow = lexical, middle = semantic, deep = alignment ([Tenney et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06316)).  
   - If reconciliation is pushed deeper, instability appears to emerge later.  

3. **Prompt handling differences**  
   - Some families stabilize early around system prompts, others revisit them dynamically ([Xie et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23123)).  

4. **Conflict resolution styles**  
   - *Early debaters*: high initial disagreement, then converge (Nous).  
   - *Late arbitrators*: stable early, fracture later under conflict (Mistral).  

5. **Sliding windows**  
   - Instability windows may shift later with longer prompts, consistent with research showing context length changes attention allocation ([Press et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03621v1)). This would require adaptive window logic instead of pre-selecting windows to make the approach robust.

## 6. Results
### Historic Results
For historic results on toy instructions and fully synthetic data see [synthetic_results.md](synthetic_results.md)

### AdvBench Results
> Note: benigns were synthetic placeholders; future work will validate on naturally occurring benign prompts. Results are preliminary. The reported AUROCs and TPR/FPR trade-offs reflect specific system prompts and synthetic benign datasets, and may not generalize across broader benign distributions.*

#### Nous

This experiment evaluates whether instability across attention heads can discriminate between attack and benign prompts under a weak system prompt condition. Using the AdvBench dataset and a synthetic benign set, the detector is tasked with identifying malicious prompts while tolerating low false positive rates.

##### Run Results
The table summarizes performance for the Nous-Capybara-7B-V1.9 model. We see clear separation between benign and attack instability distributions, with AUROC = 0.924, showing that instability is a strong discriminator.

##### Interpretation
- **Distributions:** Attack prompts consistently show higher instability (mean ≈ 0.120) than benign ones (mean ≈ 0.097).
- **AUROC (0.924):** The separation is strong; the detector can rank attacks above benign most of the time.
- **Thresholding:** At 5% FPR, the detector recovers ~88.6% TPR, meaning most attacks are caught while allowing ~1 in 20 benigns to be misclassified.
- **Entropy Correlation:** Weak negative Pearson/Spearman correlations suggest instability provides signal somewhat independent of entropy, making it complementary.

---

The ROC curve shows near-perfect separation in the low-FPR region, with rapid rise in TPR even at very small FPR. This indicates that the instability measure is robust for early detection.
![ROC Curve](figs/models_Nous-Capybara-7B-V1.9_sys_prompt_advbench_low.txt_advbench_benign.txt/roc.png)

The violin plot illustrates distributional separation: benign prompts cluster tightly around ~0.097 instability, while attack prompts are shifted upward with a broader spread around ~0.120. Despite some overlap, the margin is significant enough to enable effective discrimination.

##### Interpretation
- **Distributions:** Attack prompts show substantially higher instability (mean ≈ 0.121) than benign (mean ≈ 0.087). The benign distribution is tighter, while attack prompts are broader and shifted upward.  
- **AUROC (0.926):** The separation is strong, similar in quality to Nous, though arising later in the generation window.  
- **Thresholding:** At 5% FPR, the detector recovers ~76.5% TPR. This is lower than Nous at the same FPR, suggesting Mistral’s later instability is somewhat harder to exploit.  
- **Entropy Correlation:** Pearson (-0.289) and Spearman (-0.332) correlations with entropy are moderately negative, reinforcing that instability captures a signal distinct from uncertainty.  

---

The ROC curve confirms that instability offers a reliable discriminator, with high TPR achieved at low FPR. The curve rises smoothly, though less sharply than Nous in the lowest-FPR region.  
![ROC Curve](figs/models_Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3_sys_prompt_advbench_low.txt_advbench_benign.txt/roc.png)

The violin plot illustrates separation across distributions: benign prompts cluster around ~0.087, while attacks shift upward toward ~0.121 with greater variance. This wider spread suggests some attacks trigger stronger disagreement among heads than others.

## Calibration vs. Evaluation

A key design choice is to **separate calibration from evaluation** to avoid after-the-fact cherry-picking of windows and thresholds.

### 7. Calibration (Probe Set)
- A **small, synthetic probe set** of 50 adversarial instructions and 50 benign instructions was created.  
- These are **not drawn from AdvBench** or any evaluation dataset.  
- Purpose: identify (a) the instability window (start/end decoding steps) and (b) a candidate threshold that separates attacks from benign with low false positives.
- This step is **model-family specific**:
  - **Nous-Capybara-7B** → Window = 1–7  @ 1% FPR
  - **Mistral-7B-Instruct** → Window = 11–26 @ 1% FPR 

### Evaluation (Held-Out Datasets)
- Once calibrated, these windows/thresholds are used for evaluaitons. Window selecitons are frozen, threshold selection is still not quite perfect, so more work needs to go into probe analsyis before results can be taken seriously.
- Evaluation sets include:
  - **AdvBench attacks (520 prompts)**  
  - **Synthetic benign prompts (520 prompts)**  

### Why This Matters
- Prevents “after-the-fact” selection of favorable windows.  
- Shows that instability windows appear to be **model-dependent** (might generalize across datasets, but further experiments required) rather than dataset-dependent.  
- Provides a repeatable protocol: probe set → calibration → fixed parameters → evaluation.

## 8. Methodology  
**Acquiring Heuristics**
1. Run gather.py with attack/benin probes and an aligned system prompt.
2. Run analyze.py to extract heuristics from the probes.
3. Use the extracted heuristics in runs on AdvBench

**Signal definition:**  
1. For each decoding step, compute attention on system tokens.  
2. Compute per-layer std across heads.  
3. Average over trimmed middle layers and a short decode window.  

**Calibration:**  
- Nous-Capybara-7B → steps 1-7 / Threshold: 0.11
- Mistral-7B-Instruct → steps 11-26 / Threshold: 0.11

**Reproducibility:**  
- Deterministic decoding (`temperature=0`, `seed=1000003`, `top_k=0`, `top_p=None`).
- Future evals will use realistic real-world settings to test generality.

---

## 9. Limitations
- This is likely a statistical representaiton of the **distraction effect**, (Hung et al), without important head analysis or needing to re-tune on new system instructions.
- **Model-specific calibration** (windows/thresholds).
- Analyzing windows/thresholds is not perfect, there is some manual tuning required, the windows seem good but the threshold does not (e.g., 0.09 analyzed threshold for FPR 2% - 0.11 in AdvBench produces 2.88% FPR). This requires more investigation across various datasets.
- Only 2 model families tested so far.  
- Std across heads on system-share is one design; other coordination measures (e.g., pairwise correlations, KL) may be better.

---

## 10. Future Work  
- Validate across broader architectures (Qwen, GPT-OSS, etc.).  
- Explore normalized metrics for cross-model universality.  
- Test correlation with jailbreak success rates in the wild.  
- Study length-dependent sliding windows and adaptive logic.  

---

## 11. Workflow

Ensure the `models/` directory exists with the models you want to test:
```
models/Nous-Capybara-7B-V1.9
models/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3
```

Install:
```
python -m venv dh
source dh/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To calibrate a new model, you can use `gather.py` and then `analyze_thresholds.py`:
```
python gather.py --model models/MODEL_NAME --system-prompt-file system_prompts/sys_prompt_probe.txt --attacks-prompts-file datasets/custom_dataset_attacks_probe.txt --benign-prompts-file datasets/custom_dataset_benign_probe.txt --outputs-root outputs/MODEL_NAME

python analyze_thresholds.py --attacks-root outputs/MODEL_NAME/attacks --benign-root outputs/MODEL_NAME/benign --fprs 0.01 0.05
```

Which will produce results similar to:
```
Loaded runs: 100 | attacks=50 | benign=50
[auto-window] Tmax=159 → starts=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]...[18, 19, 20], ends=[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]...[78, 79, 80]
